### Data Analysis Overview

We are analyzing **SP400 Mid Cap Index companies** for return anomaly detection. 
The data was fetched using the **EOD Data API**, and we constructed equal-weight sector indices for a total of **11 sectors**. 
Using an **equal-weight index** can help some small-cap companies gain more prominence, enhancing the ability to identify anomalies.

#### Data Overview:
**Training Data**: Includes OHLCV and daily return data from **early 2000 to 2019-09-25** for training all models.  
**Out-of-Sample Data**: Covers the period from **2019-09-26 to 2024-08-30** for anomaly identification.

#### Sectors Analyzed:
1. **Materials**: Companies involved in mining, refining, and chemical production.
2. **Industrials**: Businesses focused on manufacturing and infrastructure.
3. **Health Care**: Providers of medical services, equipment, and pharmaceuticals.
4. **Real Estate**: Firms managing property investments and developments.
5. **Consumer Discretionary**: Retailers and luxury goods producers.
6. **Financials**: Banks, insurance, and investment firms.
7. **Utilities**: Providers of essential services like electricity and water.
8. **Information Technology**: Developers of software, hardware, and IT services.
9. **Energy**: Oil, gas, and renewable energy companies.
10. **Consumer Staples**: Producers of essential goods like food and household items.
11. **Communication Services**: Media, telecommunications, and entertainment providers.

### Model Demonstration

We deployed **6 models**, here is a short demonstration of each model:

##### Dynamic Thresholding CNN Autoencoder
The CNN-Dynamic model uses two stacks of 1D CNNs in the encoder and decoder to reconstruct 15-day return sequences by minimizing MSE loss. 
During inference, it processes unseen sector returns, reconstructs the data, and flags anomalies when reconstruction errors exceed volatility-adjusted thresholds.
This dynamic thresholding adapts to different market conditions, enhancing anomaly detection.

##### Dynamic Thresholding LSTM Autoencoder     
The LSTM-Dynamic model utilizes stacked LSTM layers in both the encoder and decoder to reconstruct 15-day return sequences by minimizing MAE loss. 
Similar to CNN Autoencoder, dynamic threshold technique is implemented for robust anomaly detection adjusted for different market conditions. 
            
##### K-nearest neighbors
The model implements dynamic KNN outlier detection on the log returns of each sector, where the number of k is adjusted based on sector volatility. 
Sectors with higher volatility use a larger k, enhancing the model's flexibility to adapt to varying characteristics. 
Additionally, rolling standard deviation is calculated over a defined window to measure each sector's volatility over time. 
This rolling volatility influences both k and a dynamic threshold for outlier detection, enabling the model to identify outlier relative to recent volatility and adapt to changing market conditions.

            
##### Isolation forest
The Isolation Forest model leverages a robust ensemble of binary trees to identify anomalies based on their rarity and distinctiveness in the data.
It isolates data points through recursive partitioning, with anomalies requiring fewer splits and resulting in shorter path lengths.
During inference, the model computes anomaly scores for unseen sector returns, dynamically adjusting thresholds based on volatility regimes.
            
##### Mahalanobis distance
Placeholder
            
##### Statistics   
The main idea of the model is that given the current segment, if the new incoming point is from the same distribution, 
the likelihood function ideally should be maximized under the new estimated distribution parameter. 
The length of our window increases until a change point is detected. 

Please go to the **ModelComparison** page for a detailed quantitative comparison between models for anomaly flags across different sectors.

### Consensus Model for Anomaly Detection

To enhance the robustness and accuracy of our analysis, we created a **Consensus Model** that combines the outputs of all models to identify meaningful anomaly points. 

#### Why Use a Consensus Model?
- **Improved Accuracy**: By aggregating results from multiple models, we reduce the likelihood of false positives and false negatives.
- **Reduced Bias**: Individual model biases are mitigated through a collective decision-making process.
- **Enhanced Robustness**: The consensus approach leverages diverse model strengths to improve reliability.

#### How It Works:
The consensus model operates on a **majority voting mechanism**:
If **three or more models** flag a specific date as anomalous, the consensus model marks that date as an anomaly.
            
Please go to the **ConsensusModelAnomaly** page for detailed identification of anomaly periods and dates.
