       "  'body': 'Find the latest Barron\\'s stories on MW for well-rounded coverage and more expert financial advice you can trust.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve\\'s that it is serious about fighting inflation. But the Fed\\'s communication is mixed and incongruous, making it tougher for investors to know which poison the central bank will pick.\\n\\nFirst, . The Fed expressed optimism over economic growth, saying that activity has picked up after declining in the first quarter, as job gains have been robust and unemployment low. That optimism is misplaced, in part because the job market is a lagging indicator, says George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG\\'s institutional client group.\\n\\nMoreover, it conflicts with what the Fed didn\\'t say. The new statement dropped a key line that had said the \"committee expects inflation to return to its 2% objective and the labor market to remain strong.\" The removal of that sentence seems an admission that it probably can\\'t achieve a return to low and stable inflation without hurting the job market, says Goncalves, .\\n\\nNote to Readers\\n\\nThis column wants to hear from you. What are economic conditions like for you? Please email lisa.beilfuss@barrons.com\\n\\nThen, , updated from March. Strategists mostly agree that the new gross-domestic-product, inflation, and unemployment forecasts together paint a more negative picture than they had previously. But they don\\'t add up. The numbers suggest that the Fed expects inflation to return within striking distance of its 2% target by 2024 -- a long way from the current 8.6% pace of consumer price inflation -- as the unemployment rate rises from 3.7% this year to 4.1% in 2024. Some economists say that is enough of a move to trigger a recession, and some say it is still far too low an estimate if inflation is to return to target during that time frame. Yet the Fed predicts growth of 1.7% this year and next, and 1.9% in 2024. That can\\'t all be true.\\n\\nNow, consider Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\\'s press conference on Wednesday. Goncalves says the prepared remarks suggest that the Fed is resolved to corral inflation as quickly as possible. But then came the Q&A with reporters. \"The dovish overtures surfaced,\" he says, and Powell seemed apologetic for the biggest interest-rate hike in three decades. While the dual mandate of stable inflation and full employment is always challenging when inflation is running hot, Goncalves says the Fed is still skittish about fighting inflation. That means more inflation until the Fed shows more conviction, especially as recent survey data suggest that inflation expectations are at risk of becoming unmoored, he says.\\n\\nHow, then, to predict what will follow a dovish three-quarter-point rate hike? Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies, says track the data instead of the Fed\\'s guidance. While Powell said that rate increases of June\\'s magnitude wouldn\\'t be \"common,\" she says the data will push the Fed to another 0.75-percentage-point increase in July, followed by half-point hikes in September and November, and then three quarter-point increases thereafter. That would bring the policy rate to over 4% by March 2023. The Fed\\'s projections show an expected rate of 3.8% in 2023 and 3.4% in 2024.\\n\\nAll of that, of course, assumes the Fed will act on inflation data over growth data. Recent reports representing the latter have been discouraging, with retail sales disappointing, jobless claims drifting higher, the Philadelphia Fed\\'s manufacturing index contracting, and the Atlanta Fed\\'s GDP model now signaling zero growth for the second quarter. Those data were released before the latest rate increase was announced, and policy works with a lag of about a year. The producer price index, meanwhile, showed that the rate of wholesale price increases doubled in May from April. Given how the war in Ukraine is exacerbating energy and food shortages, it is hard to see prices coming down soon.\\n\\nWhat this means is that stagflation is here, and the strong job market Powell has pointed to won\\'t last, says Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University. He says the Fed\\'s optimistic inflation projections \"will take a few more bazookas\" to achieve. Or not. \"They missed their opportunity to own their tightening stance,\" says Goncalves, because accompanying communications undermined the heft of the rate hike.\\n\\nIt isn\\'t hard to see why the Fed is worried about more aggressive tightening. Sohn notes from about 3% in December translates to a 44% increase in the monthly payment for a $300,000 mortgage. That is as the average credit-card interest rate is headed toward 20% by year end, he says, at a time when more consumers are turning to credit to pay for food and gas. And it is before the second part of this cycle\\'s tightening -- balance-sheet shrinkage -- really gets started.\\n\\nMore pain for the economy and financial markets is coming. That pain is probably going to coexist with high inflation for a while, given the inability for higher interest rates to really cool demand for inelastic items -- food and energy -- where inflation is most acute. While the latest rate hike shows the Fed is stepping up its efforts to fight inflation, the Fed\\'s own communications mix the message and make it less clear which pain -- growth or inflation -- the central bank will prioritize in the months ahead.\\n\\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at',\n",

       " {'title': 'Private Investors Buy Up Retail Real Estate as Bigger Players Remain Cautious',\n",
       "  'body': 'While many real-estate investment trusts and other big players remain cautious, retail property sales are increasing to family offices, wealthy individuals and small private investment firms. These buyers, who are more nimble than big companies, were responsible for nearly three-quarters of retail-asset acquisitions in 2021, a 30% increase from the 10-year historical average, according to real-estate services firm JLL.\\n\\nIf current trends persist, brokers expect REITs and major institutions to follow these smaller investors to the market. \"We expect all of the major capital sources to want to have exposure to retail,\" said Danny Finkle, co-head of retail capital markets at JLL.\\n\\nThe renewed investor interest in retail marks a turnaround for a sector that has been struggling to adapt to the rise in e-commerce since before the pandemic.\\n\\nRetail property transaction volume in the U.S. surged last year to nearly $82 billion, a 24% increase from 2019, according to MSCI Real Assets. The enthusiasm continued in the first quarter of this year, with transaction volume hitting $25 billion by April 30, an 82% increase over the same period in 2021.\\n\\nInvestors are warming to retail partly because of population shifts that favor suburban shopping, as evidenced by the growing popularity of open-air shopping centers. Meanwhile, the retailers that survived the pandemic\\'s initial lockdowns and surge in online shopping have found many customers still want to shop in person.\\n\\nThe share of e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales has been falling since it jumped at the start of the pandemic. Online sales comprised 14.3% of overall retail sales last quarter, according to JLL, still higher than before the pandemic, but down from 16.4% in the second quarter of 2020.\\n\\nMany retailers are paying their rent on time, looking to expand and, increasingly, competing for limited square footage. New retail development has been slow since 2009 and the lack of supply has started to push up rents, according to JLL.\\n\\nRetail investor Time Equities has noticed new and stronger competition, particularly from other private investors and even hedge funds, since late 2020, according to Ami Ziff, the firm\\'s managing director for national retail. The new bidders are particularly active in bids for grocery-anchored shopping centers and properties in more far-flung parts of the country.\\n\\n\"Things have not only stabilized, but conditions have improved to some of the best fundamentals I\\'ve seen since 2007, maybe better,\" Mr. Ziff said.\\n\\nRetail property is appealing to investors also because prices and returns remain attractive, especially compared with the favored commercial property types, like warehouses and rental apartments. While nearly all property types are down since the start of the year, retail REITs have outperformed apartment and industrial stocks, according to data from Bloomberg, Nareit and Green Street.\\n\\nIn Port Charlotte, Fla., a small city on the Gulf Coast about halfway between Sarasota and Fort Myers, a bidding war broke out earlier this year over a 140,000-square-foot shopping center anchored by an Office Depot. The center attracted 19 bidders, mostly private investors, and sold last month for $19 million, or 20% more than it was in contract for two years earlier before the pandemic derailed the sale, according to Jim Michalak, managing partner at Plaza Advisors, the broker who represented the seller, a New York-based private-equity group.\\n\\nThe bidding was strong in part because of low retail supply in the area and also because the shopping center\\'s 83% occupancy rate and Office Depot\\'s plans to depart by next year offer new owners the opportunity to add higher-paying tenants. Mr. Michalak said that the buyer is confident that retailer demand is strong enough to fill the space at attractive rents, with two possible tenants already considering the anchor location.\\n\\n\"Private investors have migrated to acquiring shopping centers because of better yields, compared with other real estate,\" Mr. Michalak said.\\n\\nInvesting in retail remains a risky business. Rising interest rates are tanking some deals, and overall commercial property sales were down 16% in April, compared with the same month in 2021, after 13 straight months of increases, according to MSCI Real Assets.\\n\\nBut Mr. Finkle and others said they expect retail assets will continue to attract capital.\\n\\n\"I think people are trying to understand if a recession is coming and what will be the extent of inflation,\" he said. \"But, so long as retail fundamentals continue to perform, investors will continue to invest in retail assets.\"',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Federal Reserve is rolling out the heavy artillery in its bid to fight a historic inflation spike that has shown little let-up.\\n\\nBut the aggressive strategy is expected to further slow the economy and increases the risk of recession. It already has triggered a brutal market sell-off.\\n\\nThe Fed raised its key short-term interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point Wednesday - its largest hike since 1994 - to a range of 1.5% to 1.75. It also downgraded its economic forecast.\\n\\nIt also signaled that more big moves may be coming. Fed officials forecast the federal funds rate will end 2022 at a range off 3.25% to 3.5%, according to their median estimate. That suggests officials are tentatively planning another three-quarters point increase in July and a half point rise in September before throttling back to more typical quarter-point increases the rest of the year.\\n\\n\"The (Fed\\'s policymaking committee) is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,\" the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting.\\n\\nTo put the Fed\\'s abrupt turnabout in perspective, the key rate began 2022 near zero and its half-point increase in March was the largest since 2000. At that time, officials predicted the rate would rise to about 1.9% by December.\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s hike Wednesday and its new projections are expected to ripple through the economy, sharply pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and mortgages, among other loans. Fixed, 30-year mortgages already have climbed to 5.23% from 3.22% early this year on the expectation of significant Fed moves.\\n\\nAt the same time, Americans, particularly seniors, should reap the benefits of higher bank savings rates after years of piddling returns.\\n\\nThe Fed lifts rates to curb borrowing, cool off an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth.\\n\\nJust in recent days, Fed officials have ratcheted up their rate hike plans amid signs that inflation appears more entrenched than previously thought, according to reports by Barclays and the Wall Street Journal. In early May, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested that half point rate increases were likely at both June and July meetings but policymakers had no plans for a three-quarters point move, a view that lifted markets.\\n\\nBut after starting to ease in April, the consumer price index (CPI) surged 8.6% annually in May, a new 40-year high, the Labor Department reported last week. Equally worrisome, the University of Michigan\\'s measure of consumer inflation expectations, which can affect actual price increases, also jumped last month.\\n\\n\"This raises the risk that a self-reinforcing inflationary cycle could take shape,\" Barclays economists wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nA three-quarters point move sends \"a resounding signal of the Fed\\'s resolve to guide inflation back to its 2% target,\" Barclays said.\\n\\nThe Fed now expects its preferred yearly inflation measure, which is different than the CPI, to drop from 6.3% in April to 5.2% by the end of the year, up from its March estimate of 4.3%. It predicts a core reading that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.3% at year-end, above its prior 4.1% projection.\\n\\nThe sharply higher interest rates are likely to further slow an economy that already has been moderating. The Fed on Wednesday said it expects the economy to grow 1.7% in both 2022 and 2023, down from its March estimate of 2.8% and 2.2%, respectively, according to officials\\' median forecast.\\n\\nAnd it predicts the unemployment rate, now just above a 50-year low at 3.6%, will rise to 3.7% by the end of the year and 3.9% by the end of 2023. It had projected a decline to 3.5%.\\n\\nEconomic output increased 5.7% last year, the most since 1984, on a reopening economy, increasing COVID vaccinations and massive federal aid to households.\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s bolder rate-hike strategy is an acknowledgement it\\'s now more willing to tolerate rising unemployment and the risk of recession to corral inflation, Barclays says. Last month, Powell and other Fed officials said the job market was so vibrant they likely could steer the economy to a \"soft landing\" of moderately slowing growth that keeps unemployment stable while taming inflation.\\n\\nBut while the labor market is still robust, adding about 400,000 jobs a month in recent months, the economy has already begun pulling back, both because of soaring inflation and rising interest rates. A measure of business investment rose less than expected in April. The Commerce Department said Wednesday that retail sales fell 0.3% in May. And higher mortgage rates are cooling the housing market.\\n\\nNormally, the Fed nudges up rates to contain inflation. But it now runs the risk that big rate increase will topple an already-slowing economy into recession by next year.\\n\\nSome economists believe the Fed is going too far. Inflation is likely to slow as supply chain troubles continue to ease and more Americans return to the work force, relieving workers shortages and rapid wage growth.\\n\\n\"Our objection to this more aggressive (Fed) action is that it is unnecessary because the forces which have driven the recent inflation numbers are already fading,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nThe Fed has been forced into its hard-nosed strategy because it underestimated inflation\\'s staying power through most of last year. Officials believed skyrocketing prices would retreat quickly as supply problems resolved and consumer purchases sparked by the recovery from the COVID downturn returned to normal. Russia\\'s war on Ukraine and the Delta variant, in part, disrupted that scenario.\\n\\nFed officials were more intent on supporting the recovering economy and ensuring Americans came back to a favorable job market than on curbing inflation.\\n\\nThe central bank on Wednesday also said it has started shedding the trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities it has amassed to lower long-term rates.\\n\\nRather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks to reporters after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in an emergency move designed to shield the world\\'s largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus, during a news conference in Washington, March 3, 2020.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday launched its biggest broadside yet against inflation, raising benchmark interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point in a move that equates to the most aggressive hike since 1994.\\n\\nEnding weeks of speculation, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee took the level of its benchmark funds rate to a range of 1.5%-1.75%, the highest since just before the Covid pandemic began in March 2020.\\n\\nAdditionally, members indicated a much stronger path of rate increases ahead to arrest inflation moving at its fastest pace going back to December 1981, according to one commonly cited measure.\\n\\nAccording to the \"dot plot\" of individual members\\' expectations, the Fed\\'s benchmark rate will end the year at 3.4%, an upward revision of 1.5 percentage points from the March estimate. The committee then sees the rate rising to 3.8% in 2023, a full percentage point ramp higher.\\n\\nOfficials also significantly cut their outlook for 2022 economic growth, now anticipating just a 1.7% gain in GDP, down from 2.8% from March.\\n\\nThe inflation projection as gauged by personal consumption expenditures also rose to 5.2% this year from 4.3%, though core inflation, which excludes rapidly rising food and energy costs, is indicated at 4.3%, up just 0.2 percentage points from the previous projection. Core PCE inflation ran at 4.9% in May, so the projections Wednesday anticipate an easing of price pressures in coming months.\\n\\nThe committee\\'s statement painted a largely optimistic picture of the economy even with higher inflation.\\n\\n\"Overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter,\" the statement said. \"Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.\"\\n\\nIndeed, the estimates as expressed through the committee\\'s summary of economic projections see inflation moving sharply lower in 2023, down to 2.6% headline and 2.7% core, projections little changed from March.\\n\\nLonger-term, the committee outlook for policy largely matches market projections which see a series of increases ahead that would take the funds rate to about 3.8%, its highest level since late 2007.\\n\\nThe statement was approved by all FOMC members except for Kansas City Fed President Esther George, who preferred a smaller half-point increase.\\n\\nBanks use the rate as a benchmark for what the charge each other for short-term borrowing. However, it feeds directly through to a multitude of consumer debt products, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, credit cards and auto loans.\\n\\nThe funds rate also can drive rates on savings accounts and CDs higher, though the feed-through on that generally takes longer.\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s move comes with inflation running at its fastest pace in more than 40 years. Central bank officials use the funds rate to try to slow down the economy - in this case to tamp down demand so that supply can catch up.\\n\\nHowever, the post-meeting statement removed a long-used phrase indicating that the FOMC \"expects inflation to return to its 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong.\" The statement only noted that the Fed \"is strongly committed\" to the goal.\\n\\nThe policy tightening is happening with economic growth already tailing off while prices still rise, a condition known as stagflation.\\n\\nFirst-quarter growth declined at a 1.5% annualized pace, and an updated estimate Wednesday from the Atlanta Fed, through its GDPNow tracker, put the second quarter as flat. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth is a widely used rule of thumb to delineate a recession.\\n\\nFed officials engaged in a public bout of hand-wringing heading into Wednesday\\'s decision.\\n\\nFor weeks, policymakers had been insisting that half-point - or 50-basis-point - increases could help arrest inflation. In recent days, though, CNBC and other media outlets reported that conditions were ripe for the Fed to go beyond that. The changed approach came even though Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in May had insisted that hiking by 75 basis points was not being considered.\\n\\nHowever, a recent series of alarming signals triggered the more aggressive action.\\n\\nInflation as measured by the consumer price index rose 8.6% on a yearly basis in May. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey hit an all-time low that included sharply higher inflation expectations. Also, retail sales numbers released Wednesday confirmed that the all-important consumer is weakening, with sales dropping 0.3% for a month in which inflation rose 1%.\\n\\nThe jobs market has been a point of strength for the economy, though May\\'s 390,000 gain was the lowest since April 2021. Average hourly earnings have been rising in nominal terms, but when adjusted for inflation have fallen 3% over the past year.\\n\\nThe committee projections released Wednesday see the unemployment rate, currently at 3.6%, moving up to 4.1% by 2024.\\n\\nAll of those factors have combined to complicate Powell\\'s hopes for a \"soft or softish\" landing that he expressed in May.

       "  'body': 'The pullback in spending is another indicator showing the economy is losing momentum as the Federal Reserve takes action to raise interest rates and combat historically high inflation.\\n\\nConsumer spending, buoyed by strong job growth and stimulus measures, was the backbone of the country\\'s economic recovery since a brief recession occurred in early 2020. That strength is fading in the face of the strongest pace of inflation in four decades. \"Now consumers are planning to take a back seat,\" said Beth Ann Bovino, U.S. chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. \"How far they\\'re planning to sit back -- it\\'s still an open question.\"\\n\\nA sharp drop in vehicle sales -- due to high prices, low inventory and rising interest rates on car loans -- played an outsize role in the decline in month-over-month retail spending. Consumers also pulled back their spending on goods such as furniture, electronics and online purchases.\\n\\nHigher borrowing costs are hitting the housing market as well, with the National Association of Home Builders reporting Wednesday that confidence among home builders in the U.S. decreased in June for the sixth consecutive month.\\n\\nMore broadly, monthly job gains slowed in May, as did annual wage increases. Consumer spending eased in April and the saving rate fell to the lowest in 14 years, suggesting many Americans are tapping savings to offset cost increases from inflation.\\n\\nThe weaker-than-expected retail sales in May and a downward revision to April spending prompted some economists to downgrade their expectations for economic growth in the second quarter. The economy contracted in the first quarter.\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts lowered their forecast for U.S. gross domestic product growth to an annual rate of 2.5% in the second quarter from 3.25% previously. Data firm IHS Markit cut its growth estimate to 0.9%.\\n\\nExcluding autos and gasoline, retail sales rose just 0.1% in May, well behind the pace at which prices increased last month. Unlike other reports compiled by the government, retail sales aren\\'t adjusted for inflation. Soaring gasoline and grocery prices meant households shelled out more on them in May -- Americans are spending over 43% more on gasoline than a year ago and nearly 9% more on groceries.\\n\\nRetail sales were up 8.1% last month from a year earlier, a robust gain but below the blistering pace of inflation, which was up 8.6% in May from a year earlier, according to the Labor Department\\'s consumer-price index.\\n\\nInterest rates look set to rise further, a potential damper on consumer spending in the months ahead as car loans and credit-card debt get more expensive. Later Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is set to wrap up a two-day policy meeting. A string of troubling inflation reports in recent days is likely to lead Fed officials to consider a larger-than-expected 0.75-percentage-point interest-rate increase.\\n\\nConsumers are getting less for their money due to rapidly rising prices. The dynamic is also driving a shift from discretionary purchases such as furniture and electronics to essentials like food and gasoline.\\n\\nThe average cost of a gallon of regular gasoline exceeded $4.60 a gallon in late May, up from about $3 a gallon a year earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Prices in June have risen above $5 a gallon.\\n\\nLogan CoBell, 33 years old, who works in Chicago as a bartender and substitute teacher, said he is driving only for essential reasons, such as commuting to work, to save money on gasoline. He is watching his spending at the grocery store by cutting down on purchases of red meat and opting for cheaper alternatives such as pork and nonorganic chicken.\\n\\nMr. CoBell said he was holding off on upgrading to a new computer \"so I have cash in hand just in case something weird happens, like another shutdown.\"\\n\\nCompanies are struggling with higher inflation, which they say is increasingly hard to pass on to consumers. Some large retailers such as Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. in recent weeks reported steep profit declines as rising supply-chain, wage and inflation-related costs ate into earnings.\\n\\nInflation and high fuel prices are also taking a toll on consumer confidence. Last week the University of Michigan reported that an index of consumer sentiment dropped in June to its lowest point since the inception of the survey in the late 1940s.\\n\\nBill Stoops, a 72-year old retiree living in San Diego, said the hit to asset values from financial-market turmoil in recent months means he is pulling in some spending.\\n\\n\"We thought about planning a trip to France and Germany, maybe Italy -- we still want to do that but we don\\'t see it for this year at all,\" he said, adding \"I\\'m no longer talking about replacing my current fun car with another fun car.\"\\n\\nConsumers are also continuing to shift spending to services from goods as many Americans resume more in-person activities such as travel and dining out.\\n\\nThe retail sales report mostly covers spending on goods rather than services, but it said that receipts at bars and restaurants were up 0.7% in May, a sign that Americans are continuing to dine out.\\n\\nConsumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic output. A strong labor market and rising wages have helped support spending on services, for which there is pent-up demand from the pandemic.\\n\\nCraig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a research and consulting firm, said he anticipates a slowdown in retail spending.\\n\\n\"We\\'re in a little bit of a watershed in terms of what\\'s going to happen to the economy,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"The American consumer -- she\\'s very resilient, but she\\'s not infinitely resilient.',\n",

       "  'body': 'WASHINGTON, June 15 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden\\'s top officials and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were quick to dismiss the first embers of inflation in the spring of 2021 in a single word: Transitory.\\n\\nMore than a year later, price increases at 40-year peaks have proven to be anything but, so much so that the Fed this week appears ready to hike interest rates by the most since 1994 to quell them. Biden, meanwhile, is paying the political price for being the face Americans blame for $5 a gallon gas and 10% price increases for eggs.\\n\\nIn truth, the culprits contributing to the current U.S. inflation are numerous. Fiscal spending likely went a step too far; a red-hot job market lifted worker pay the most in a generation; global supply shocks kept coming instead of easing; the war in Ukraine created food and fuel scarcities.\\n\\nBut both the Fed and Biden administration were slow to shift their focus from fighting the economic shock of the pandemic, particularly on employment, to controlling inflation that is so acute the central bank is willing to court a recession to fix it.\\n\\nBy mid-summer 2021, the pandemic employment hole was still nearly 7 million jobs, but price increases were already running at their highest in a decade and twice the Fed\\'s 2% a year target. Biden and Powell each referred to \"transitory\" inflation within days of each other that July. Biden did so in a speech marking his first six months in office and Powell in his press conference following that month\\'s Fed policy meeting.\\n\\nBy September, the Fed appeared to finally take note, when it signaled the labor market conditions it had set for dialing back its bond purchases - the first step toward higher rates - would soon be met. The consumer price index then had climbed by more than 5% year-on-year, belying expectations for an easing.\\n\\nWhen the Fed actually started reducing its asset purchases in November it would be north of 6%.\\n\\nConsumers noticed as well. A measure of near-term inflation expectations from the University of Michigan that month hit its highest since 2008.\\n\\nThat presented the first inklings of a new and deeper problem.\\n\\nHigh inflation becoming rooted in public psychology is something Fed officials have feared as it lowers obstacles for companies to raise prices, keeps consumers spending furiously, and undermines the Fed\\'s own credibility as an inflation fighter.\\n\\nIndeed, that risk - which has only grown this year - is now central to the rapid change in the Fed\\'s posture. read more \"As soon as (inflation) expectations move, you have to hit like a hammer. Do more and do it quick. That is where we are,\" said Larry Meyer, a former Fed governor and chief executive of LHMeyer, referring to the prospect of a three quarter point Fed rate hike this week.\\n\\nFor its part, the White House in mid-2021 created a task force to deal with supply chain snarls, thick with retail and logistics company leaders, tried to stamp down rising oil prices with releases from the strategic petroleum reserve and focused on anti-competitive practices in key industries.\\n\\nIn December, Biden declared victory over empty shelves, seconded by FedEx Corp (FDX.N) chief executive Fred Smith.\\n\\nBut inflation did not respond, prompting Biden in the fall to double down on his big plan to fix it. The Build Back Better Act aimed hundreds of billions of dollars in investment at reducing health care, housing, childcare and prescription drug costs, among other issues.\\n\\nInstead, it died in Congress after negotiations failed between the White House, and progressive Democrats and hold out senators.\\n\\nBy May of this year, Biden was highlighting the role the Fed, not the White House, would play in reducing inflation, while promising to look at tariffs on goods from China and other issues that could have some impact.\\n\\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen, a key promoter of the term \"transitory,\" publicly retired it in December, but she continued to reassure White House officials privately early this year that price pressures would ease in 2022. It was not until this month that she admitted her mistake. read more\\n\\nWhite House officials now privately acknowledge they may have little control over price hikes ahead of the crucial November mid-terms, and would do what they could on the margins, while continuing to lay the blame on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine that sent fuel and food costs sky-rocketing further. read more\\n\\nOnce Fed officials this year fully embraced that the situation had changed, their response took on increasing urgency as the clamor grew from financial market actors and other critics that they were woefully behind the curve.\\n\\nThey accelerated the end of their bond purchases and in March raised the benchmark short term federal funds rate for the first time since 2018, by a quarter percentage point.\\n\\nBut even then, policymakers\\' projections signaled what, by historical standards, would be a modest rise in the federal funds rate to around 1.9% by the end of the year, with no change in unemployment from the current low rate of 3.6%.\\n\\nIn early May, they raised rates again, by half a point this time, and for weeks afterward touted a plan to raise them by that margin again at meetings in June and July.\\n\\nSince then, the outlook on prices has eroded further, with annual consumer inflation as of May accelerating to 8.6%, and persistently high prices now amounting to a generational shock. Stock markets have sunk into a full-on bear market on worries that the Fed\\'s small steps will no longer be enough, and bond yields most sensitive to central bank policy expectations have shot to their highest since 2007.\\n\\nWhen data on Friday showed a jump in consumers\\' expectations about inflation, coupled with a similar outcome in a Monday New York Fed survey, it may have convinced Fed officials that their pledge to tame prices had not yet registered - to either the public or financial markets. read more\\n\\nJason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and a Harvard University professor, said Fed officials were paying the price for policy that promised to fight inflation but lacked any firm commitment to push rates to restrictive levels.\\n\\n\"It is hard to convince people you are going to do serious things next year when you are not going to do them this year,\" he said.',\n",

A week ago, the futures market implied a 3 per cent chance of a 75 basis point increase, and a 97 per cent chance of a 50 point increase, when the Fed meets later this week. Now the odds are 28/72. The market implied fed funds rate for February 2023 has moved from 3.1 to 3.9 per cent.\\n\\nNext, the Treasury curve moved, a lot. Rates leap at all maturities, but fastest at two and five years, flattening the belly of the curve.\\n\\nNext, equities fell, a lot. The S&P dropped 6.8 per cent over two days. Everything went down, but value fell less than growth, and big caps fell less than small caps. Here is the sectoral breakdown:\\n\\nNote the familiar pattern: the growths stuff that did so well in the coronavirus pandemic sold off the hardest (the consumer discretionary sector is 43 per cent weighted to Amazon and Tesla).\\n\\nWe have seen all of this before, more or less every other time the inflation data has come in hot. Indeed, most of the S&P down days seem to follow this sort of pattern. Rate expectations up, stocks down, yields up, yesterday\\'s winners become today\\'s losers.\\n\\nA question remains, though. Is this an inflation scare, a Fed-induced recession scare, or some of both?\\n\\nThe market provides a few useful, if inconclusive, clues. First, break-even inflation has not moved much. The big jump in five-year Treasury yields, for example, has been mirrored by the jump in five-year inflation-protected Treasury (Tips) yields, leaving implied inflation flat:\\n\\nWe\\'ve argued in the past that Tips yields are probably a distorted indicator of investor expectations. Still, this chart is probably telling you something, directionally at least. It may be saying, \"The Fed is going to raise rates, but inflation will not get out of control.\" Or it may be saying, \"Inflation volatility is going up, so real rates have to rise to reflect that risk.\" Probably it is some of both. But either way, it is not screaming that inflation is going higher.\\n\\nNext, consider corporate bonds\\' yield spreads over Treasuries. They have been moving higher, and in a specific way. The spread between spreads has been increasing. That is, lower-quality bonds are seeing their spreads move higher faster than higher-quality bonds.\\n\\nBelow is the difference between investment-grade spreads and spreads just of the lowest rung of investment grade, or BBBs; the difference between BBB and the highest grade of junk bond, or single Bs; and between single Bs and the lowest grade of junk, of CCCs:\\n\\nWhen the spread between spreads widens like this, that is telling you the economy is going to get worse and defaults are going to rise. These data only go through Friday, but a reliable bond trader contact said these gaps kept right on widening.\\n\\nBoth of these points suggest that the market is primarily afraid that the Fed will tighten the economy into recession, rather than fearing that inflation will spin out of control. But on the other hand, if inflation was not a worry, you might expect the 10-year Treasury to catch a bid, rather than selling off hard. And you wouldn\\'t expect Fed fund futures to rise so sharply. So the picture is mixed. Recession is the primary risk, but the chances of a recession accompanied by high inflation -- stagflation -- are moving up too.\\n\\nOne month ago, falling crypto prices caused a badly designed stablecoin, TerraUSD, to fall apart. It was one of the most popular projects in decentralised finance -- blockchain\\'s answer to the financial services industry. Capital began fleeing DeFi. Friday\\'s inflation scare further intensified the crypto sell-off. Then, yesterday, something else broke:\\n\\nBinance on Monday halted withdrawals of bitcoin for several hours after crypto lender Celsius also blocked customers from pulling funds from its platform, citing \"extreme market conditions\"\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\n\\nCelsius is one of the biggest players in the market for digital yield products, providing users with the ability to lend out their tokens as collateral for other crypto projects. In return for lending their tokens, traders were able to earn annual yields of as much as 17 per cent\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\n\\nThe value of assets deposited on Celsius\\'s platform shrivelled to less than $12bn as of May 17 from more than $24bn in late December.\\n\\nCelsius is a (centralised) crypto lending service -- that is to say, an unregulated bank for speculators and market makers. Its capital comes from crypto deposits, drawn in by the promise of double-digit yields. These deposits are then lent out to traders.\\n\\nPeople liked earning a 17 per cent yield when times were good, but times are now bad. Celsius, it seems, did not have enough money on hand to meet all redemptions, so it halted them. In other words, Celsius is cash flow insolvent. A widely circulated note on Monday claimed it could run out of funds in five weeks.\\n\\nThis could matter beyond Celsius. It invests widely in DeFi. Larry Cermak at The Block estimates its current holdings at $1.4bn, spread across several DeFi protocols and cryptocurrencies. The company behind tether has also extended a loan to Celsius, collateralised in bitcoin. In April, Celsius boasted of holding 150,000 bitcoin, a bigger stake than even Michael Saylor\\'s MicroStrategy. If Celsius fails, crypto will take several hard punches to the face.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Binance, the biggest crypto exchange, happened to have a three-hour outage around the same time the Celsius news dropped. The exchange blamed technical issues, as it has had in the past.\\n\\nThe FT\\'s Katie Martin thinks there could be something more going on. She made the point to us yesterday that we might have entered the \"who is left holding the baby phase of the crypto crisis\". That is, the crash has gone from hurting crypto holders to threatening crypto institutions.\\n\\nAre her suspicions correct? A true crisis could develop if Binance et al have significant hidden exposure to declining prices, perhaps through DeFi investments. That aside, though, the exchanges\\' value simply depends on trading volume, which has fallen a long way since 2021. Coinbase\\'s stock is down 85 per cent from its IPO because it is a volatile business that is shrinking at the moment, not because it faces a Celsius-like liquidity crunch. Chances are the exchanges will hang on as long as people want to pay fees to trade crypto.\\n\\nA cascading crisis that brings down the biggest crypto institutions is possible. Crises tend to reveal hidden risk exposures. But consider another possibility: that many crypto businesses fail but the most important don\\'t, retail investors are left nursing huge losses without recourse, and the crypto boom-bust cycle repeats. It has happened before. (Ethan Wu)',\n",

       "  'body': 'WASHINGTON, June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in May as motor vehicle purchases declined amid shortages, and record high gasoline prices pulled spending away from other goods.\\n\\nRetail sales dropped 0.3% last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Data for April was revised lower to show sales increasing 0.7% instead of 0.9% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales gaining 0.2%, with estimates ranging from as low as a 1.1% decline to as high as a 0.5% increase.\\n\\nThe national average price of gasoline jumped to an all-time high of $4.439 per gallon in May, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\\n\\nThe decline in retail sales also reflected a gradual rotation of spending from goods to services. Retail sales are mostly goods, and are not adjusted for inflation. Bars and restaurants are the only services category in the report.\\n\\nAnnual consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 40-1/2 years in May. With inflation eroding wage gains, consumers are turning to savings, accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and taking on debt to maintain spending.\\n\\n\"A significant stockpile of household savings has helped consumers manage mounting inflation pressures to this point,\" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina.\\n\\nRetail sales are likely to remain sluggish as the Federal Reserve aggressively tightens monetary policy to cool demand and bring down inflation back to its 2% target.\\n\\nThe U.S. central bank is expected to raise its policy interest rate later on Wednesday for a third time this year, with an increase of 3/4 of a percentage point seen as likely, and possibly signals for more large hikes to come. read more\\n\\nExcluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales were unchanged in May.

       "  'body': 'New projections showed all 18 officials who participated in the meeting expect the Fed to raise rates to at least 3% this year, with at least half of all officials indicating the fed-funds rate might need to rise to around 3.375% this year.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not trying to induce a recession now. Let\\'s be clear about that,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference.\\n\\nBut he said it was becoming more difficult to achieve what is known as a soft landing, in which the economy slows enough to bring down inflation while avoiding a recession. That represented an implicit concession that the risks of a downturn could rise as the economy digests tighter monetary policy.\\n\\n\"It is not going to be easy,\" Mr. Powell said. \"There\\'s a much bigger chance now that it\\'ll depend on factors that we don\\'t control. Fluctuations and spikes in commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands.\"\\n\\nThe S&P 500 rose 54.51 points, or 1.5%, to 3789.99, snapping a five-day losing streak. U.S. government bonds rallied after sliding in recent weeks in a selloff that had pushed yields to their highest levels in more than a decade.\\n\\nLast week, the Labor Department reported the consumer-price index rose 8.6% in May, driven by higher energy prices. Rising fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions from Russia\\'s war against Ukraine have sent prices up in recent months.\\n\\nMr. Powell\\'s comments indicated that the Fed \"will have to keep jamming on the brakes even if growth struggles, and the market didn\\'t get it,\" said Priya Misra, head of interest-rate strategy at TD Securities.\\n\\nMs. Misra warned that markets would face higher volatility until inflation is clearly diminishing. \"Today, everyone is cheering, but if inflation has not peaked, we will have to go through the stress of the last few days all over again,\" she said.\\n\\nThe Fed has faced growing criticism in recent weeks for not acting sooner to withdraw aggressive stimulus it deployed through most of last year. \"Powell took a bold decision today, and it sends the kind of message the economy needs to hear,\" said Rep. French Hill (R., Ark).\\n\\nExpectations of a larger rate rise and a higher path of rate rises had convulsed bond markets in recent days. Over the five days through Tuesday, the two-year Treasury yield had climbed by 0.7 percentage point, the largest such increase since 1982, according to JPMorgan Chase.\\n\\nWednesday\\'s rate increase marked an abrupt change from unusually precise guidance delivered by many members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, who had indicated in recent weeks that they would raise rates by a smaller half percentage point, as officials did at their meeting last month.\\n\\nMr. Powell said the committee had decided to approve the larger rate rise because of concerns over recent data on inflation and expectations of future inflation, which economists say play a significant role influencing actual price rises. Mr. Powell said officials decided it didn\\'t make sense to wait until July to move to a larger rate increase.\\n\\nThe committee vote was 10-1, with Kansas City Fed President Esther George dissenting in favor of a half-percentage-point, or 50-basis-point, increase.\\n\\n\"Clearly, today\\'s 75-basis-point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common,\" Mr. Powell said. \"From the perspective of today, either a 50-basis-point or a 75-basis-point increase seems most likely at our next meeting\" on July 26-27.\\n\\nWednesday\\'s rate increase returns the Fed\\'s benchmark rate to its level in early March 2020, before the Fed slashed it to near zero as the Covid-19 pandemic hit the U.S. economy But interest rates in the U.S. and many other wealthy nations remain at very low levels historically.\\n\\nMr. Powell said he expected the central bank would raise rates to levels designed to slow the economy. \"We think that policy is going to need to be restrictive, and we don\\'t know how restrictive,\" he said.\\n\\nAt the same time, Mr. Powell said he saw no signs of a broader slowdown in the economy. \"You\\'re seeing continuing shifts in consumption...but overall spending is very strong,\" he said.\\n\\nWednesday\\'s projections showed officials see the fed-funds rate peaking at around 3.75% by the end of 2023, up from the 2.75% rate that officials projected in March but slightly below what interest-rate futures markets had anticipated earlier this week.\\n\\nSuch a pace of increases would nevertheless represent the most aggressive rate-rise cycle since the 1980s. The central bank has also initiated a program to withdraw stimulus by shrinking its $8.9 trillion asset portfolio through attrition; the Fed is passively reducing its holdings as those securities mature.\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s monetary-policy statement removed a line that, in May, had indicated officials expected inflation to return to 2% and for the labor market to remain strong as it raised rates. Mr. Powell said the removal of that sentence reflected the sense that the Fed couldn\\'t reduce inflation to 2% by itself while maintaining a strong labor market.\\n\\n\"The worst mistake we could make would be to fail\" to bring down inflation, Mr. Powell said. \"It\\'s not an option. We have to restore price stability.\"\\n\\nThe projections revealed that all but one official expect the unemployment rate to rise over the next two years, an implicit acknowledgment of rising recession risks. The median projection showed the unemployment rate, which stood at 3.6% in May, ending at 3.7% this year before rising to 4.1% in 2024.\\n\\n\"Powell told us policy is going to create a recession, but soft-peddled it enough to leave markets to figure that out for themselves,\" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard.\\n\\nThe fed-funds rate, an overnight rate on lending between banks, influences other consumer and business borrowing costs throughout the economy, including rates on mortgages, credit cards, saving accounts, car loans and corporate debt. Raising rates typically restrains spending, while cutting rates encourages such borrowing.\\n\\nThe U.S. mortgage market has been slammed by the prospect of tighter money, and many lenders were quoting a 30-year fixed rate above 6% on Monday and Tuesday, levels that haven\\'t been reached since 2008. Two large real-estate brokerages announced layoffs on Tuesday as home-purchase demand has stalled.\\n\\nMortgage rates stood near 3% at the beginning of the year. \"You can\\'t double mortgage rates in a six-month span and live to tell about it,\" said Lou Barnes, a mortgage banker in Boulder, Colo., who expected housing to go through a sharp slowdown. \"At 6%-plus, mortgages will be very painful.\"\\n\\nThe Commerce Department reported Wednesday that U.S. retail sales -- a measure of spending at stores, online and in restaurants -- fell a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in May from the previous month. That was the first decline in month-over-month retail spending this year. Monthly job gains slowed in May, as did annual wage increases.\\n\\nMarkets began to anticipate the larger 0.75-percentage point increase after a disappointing inflation report on Friday, and again after The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that such a move might occur on Wednesday.\\n\\nSome former Fed economists said the central bank risked sparking greater market volatility after the surprising shift to a larger rate rise. \"It raises questions of whether they\\'re in control of the situation. It is panicky,\" said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Dreyfus and Mellon \"It will be extremely difficult for them to control the narrative after doing 75 basis points.\"\\n\\nOthers said they viewed Mr. Powell\\'s decision as a sign that he was more committed to bring down inflation even if it risked a downturn. \"If he\\'s willing to blow up carefully laid plans to deliver a hawkish surprise, we should take him at his word that he will stay the course,\" said Ellen Meade, who retired from the Fed last August as a senior policy adviser.\\n\\nCorrections & Amplifications\\n\\nKansas City Fed President Esther George dissented in favor of a 50-basis-point increase.

       "  'body': 'Find the latest Barron\\'s stories on MW for well-rounded coverage and more expert financial advice you can trust.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve\\'s that it is serious about fighting inflation. But the Fed\\'s communication is mixed and incongruous, making it tougher for investors to know which poison the central bank will pick.\\n\\nFirst, . The Fed expressed optimism over economic growth, saying that activity has picked up after declining in the first quarter, as job gains have been robust and unemployment low. That optimism is misplaced, in part because the job market is a lagging indicator, says George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG\\'s institutional client group.\\n\\nMoreover, it conflicts with what the Fed didn\\'t say. The new statement dropped a key line that had said the \"committee expects inflation to return to its 2% objective and the labor market to remain strong.\" The removal of that sentence seems an admission that it probably can\\'t achieve a return to low and stable inflation without hurting the job market, says Goncalves, .\\n\\nNote to Readers\\n\\nThis column wants to hear from you. What are economic conditions like for you? Please email lisa.beilfuss@barrons.com\\n\\nThen, , updated from March. Strategists mostly agree that the new gross-domestic-product, inflation, and unemployment forecasts together paint a more negative picture than they had previously. But they don\\'t add up. The numbers suggest that the Fed expects inflation to return within striking distance of its 2% target by 2024 -- a long way from the current 8.6% pace of consumer price inflation -- as the unemployment rate rises from 3.7% this year to 4.1% in 2024. Some economists say that is enough of a move to trigger a recession, and some say it is still far too low an estimate if inflation is to return to target during that time frame. Yet the Fed predicts growth of 1.7% this year and next, and 1.9% in 2024. That can\\'t all be true.\\n\\nNow, consider Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\\'s press conference on Wednesday. Goncalves says the prepared remarks suggest that the Fed is resolved to corral inflation as quickly as possible. But then came the Q&A with reporters. \"The dovish overtures surfaced,\" he says, and Powell seemed apologetic for the biggest interest-rate hike in three decades. While the dual mandate of stable inflation and full employment is always challenging when inflation is running hot, Goncalves says the Fed is still skittish about fighting inflation. That means more inflation until the Fed shows more conviction, especially as recent survey data suggest that inflation expectations are at risk of becoming unmoored, he says.\\n\\nHow, then, to predict what will follow a dovish three-quarter-point rate hike? Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies, says track the data instead of the Fed\\'s guidance. While Powell said that rate increases of June\\'s magnitude wouldn\\'t be \"common,\" she says the data will push the Fed to another 0.75-percentage-point increase in July, followed by half-point hikes in September and November, and then three quarter-point increases thereafter. That would bring the policy rate to over 4% by March 2023. The Fed\\'s projections show an expected rate of 3.8% in 2023 and 3.4% in 2024.\\n\\nAll of that, of course, assumes the Fed will act on inflation data over growth data. Recent reports representing the latter have been discouraging, with retail sales disappointing, jobless claims drifting higher, the Philadelphia Fed\\'s manufacturing index contracting, and the Atlanta Fed\\'s GDP model now signaling zero growth for the second quarter. Those data were released before the latest rate increase was announced, and policy works with a lag of about a year. The producer price index, meanwhile, showed that the rate of wholesale price increases doubled in May from April. Given how the war in Ukraine is exacerbating energy and food shortages, it is hard to see prices coming down soon.\\n\\nWhat this means is that stagflation is here, and the strong job market Powell has pointed to won\\'t last, says Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University. He says the Fed\\'s optimistic inflation projections \"will take a few more bazookas\" to achieve. Or not. \"They missed their opportunity to own their tightening stance,\" says Goncalves, because accompanying communications undermined the heft of the rate hike.\\n\\nIt isn\\'t hard to see why the Fed is worried about more aggressive tightening. Sohn notes from about 3% in December translates to a 44% increase in the monthly payment for a $300,000 mortgage. That is as the average credit-card interest rate is headed toward 20% by year end, he says, at a time when more consumers are turning to credit to pay for food and gas. And it is before the second part of this cycle\\'s tightening -- balance-sheet shrinkage -- really gets started.\\n\\nMore pain for the economy and financial markets is coming. That pain is probably going to coexist with high inflation for a while, given the inability for higher interest rates to really cool demand for inelastic items -- food and energy -- where inflation is most acute. While the latest rate hike shows the Fed is stepping up its efforts to fight inflation, the Fed\\'s own communications mix the message and make it less clear which pain -- growth or inflation -- the central bank will prioritize in the months ahead.\\n\\nWrite to Lisa Beilfuss at',\n",

       "  'body': 'While many real-estate investment trusts and other big players remain cautious, retail property sales are increasing to family offices, wealthy individuals and small private investment firms. These buyers, who are more nimble than big companies, were responsible for nearly three-quarters of retail-asset acquisitions in 2021, a 30% increase from the 10-year historical average, according to real-estate services firm JLL.\\n\\nIf current trends persist, brokers expect REITs and major institutions to follow these smaller investors to the market. \"We expect all of the major capital sources to want to have exposure to retail,\" said Danny Finkle, co-head of retail capital markets at JLL.\\n\\nThe renewed investor interest in retail marks a turnaround for a sector that has been struggling to adapt to the rise in e-commerce since before the pandemic.\\n\\nRetail property transaction volume in the U.S. surged last year to nearly $82 billion, a 24% increase from 2019, according to MSCI Real Assets. The enthusiasm continued in the first quarter of this year, with transaction volume hitting $25 billion by April 30, an 82% increase over the same period in 2021.\\n\\nInvestors are warming to retail partly because of population shifts that favor suburban shopping, as evidenced by the growing popularity of open-air shopping centers. Meanwhile, the retailers that survived the pandemic\\'s initial lockdowns and surge in online shopping have found many customers still want to shop in person.\\n\\nThe share of e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales has been falling since it jumped at the start of the pandemic. Online sales comprised 14.3% of overall retail sales last quarter, according to JLL, still higher than before the pandemic, but down from 16.4% in the second quarter of 2020.\\n\\nMany retailers are paying their rent on time, looking to expand and, increasingly, competing for limited square footage. New retail development has been slow since 2009 and the lack of supply has started to push up rents, according to JLL.\\n\\nRetail investor Time Equities has noticed new and stronger competition, particularly from other private investors and even hedge funds, since late 2020, according to Ami Ziff, the firm\\'s managing director for national retail. The new bidders are particularly active in bids for grocery-anchored shopping centers and properties in more far-flung parts of the country.\\n\\n\"Things have not only stabilized, but conditions have improved to some of the best fundamentals I\\'ve seen since 2007, maybe better,\" Mr. Ziff said.\\n\\nRetail property is appealing to investors also because prices and returns remain attractive, especially compared with the favored commercial property types, like warehouses and rental apartments. While nearly all property types are down since the start of the year, retail REITs have outperformed apartment and industrial stocks, according to data from Bloomberg, Nareit and Green Street.\\n\\nIn Port Charlotte, Fla., a small city on the Gulf Coast about halfway between Sarasota and Fort Myers, a bidding war broke out earlier this year over a 140,000-square-foot shopping center anchored by an Office Depot. The center attracted 19 bidders, mostly private investors, and sold last month for $19 million, or 20% more than it was in contract for two years earlier before the pandemic derailed the sale, according to Jim Michalak, managing partner at Plaza Advisors, the broker who represented the seller, a New York-based private-equity group.\\n\\nThe bidding was strong in part because of low retail supply in the area and also because the shopping center\\'s 83% occupancy rate and Office Depot\\'s plans to depart by next year offer new owners the opportunity to add higher-paying tenants. Mr. Michalak said that the buyer is confident that retailer demand is strong enough to fill the space at attractive rents, with two possible tenants already considering the anchor location.\\n\\n\"Private investors have migrated to acquiring shopping centers because of better yields, compared with other real estate,\" Mr. Michalak said.\\n\\nInvesting in retail remains a risky business. Rising interest rates are tanking some deals, and overall commercial property sales were down 16% in April, compared with the same month in 2021, after 13 straight months of increases, according to MSCI Real Assets.\\n\\nBut Mr. Finkle and others said they expect retail assets will continue to attract capital.\\n\\n\"I think people are trying to understand if a recession is coming and what will be the extent of inflation,\" he said. \"But, so long as retail fundamentals continue to perform, investors will continue to invest in retail assets.\"',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Federal Reserve is rolling out the heavy artillery in its bid to fight a historic inflation spike that has shown little let-up.\\n\\nBut the aggressive strategy is expected to further slow the economy and increases the risk of recession. It already has triggered a brutal market sell-off.\\n\\nThe Fed raised its key short-term interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point Wednesday - its largest hike since 1994 - to a range of 1.5% to 1.75. It also downgraded its economic forecast.\\n\\nIt also signaled that more big moves may be coming. Fed officials forecast the federal funds rate will end 2022 at a range off 3.25% to 3.5%, according to their median estimate. That suggests officials are tentatively planning another three-quarters point increase in July and a half point rise in September before throttling back to more typical quarter-point increases the rest of the year.\\n\\n\"The (Fed\\'s policymaking committee) is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,\" the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting.\\n\\nTo put the Fed\\'s abrupt turnabout in perspective, the key rate began 2022 near zero and its half-point increase in March was the largest since 2000. At that time, officials predicted the rate would rise to about 1.9% by December.\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s hike Wednesday and its new projections are expected to ripple through the economy, sharply pushing up rates for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and mortgages, among other loans. Fixed, 30-year mortgages already have climbed to 5.23% from 3.22% early this year on the expectation of significant Fed moves.\\n\\nAt the same time, Americans, particularly seniors, should reap the benefits of higher bank savings rates after years of piddling returns.\\n\\nThe Fed lifts rates to curb borrowing, cool off an overheated economy and fend off inflation spikes. It lowers them to spur borrowing, economic activity and job growth.\\n\\nJust in recent days, Fed officials have ratcheted up their rate hike plans amid signs that inflation appears more entrenched than previously thought, according to reports by Barclays and the Wall Street Journal. In early May, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested that half point rate increases were likely at both June and July meetings but policymakers had no plans for a three-quarters point move, a view that lifted markets.\\n\\nBut after starting to ease in April, the consumer price index (CPI) surged 8.6% annually in May, a new 40-year high, the Labor Department reported last week. Equally worrisome, the University of Michigan\\'s measure of consumer inflation expectations, which can affect actual price increases, also jumped last month.\\n\\n\"This raises the risk that a self-reinforcing inflationary cycle could take shape,\" Barclays economists wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nA three-quarters point move sends \"a resounding signal of the Fed\\'s resolve to guide inflation back to its 2% target,\" Barclays said.\\n\\nThe Fed now expects its preferred yearly inflation measure, which is different than the CPI, to drop from 6.3% in April to 5.2% by the end of the year, up from its March estimate of 4.3%. It predicts a core reading that strips out volatile food and energy items will be 4.3% at year-end, above its prior 4.1% projection.\\n\\nThe sharply higher interest rates are likely to further slow an economy that already has been moderating. The Fed on Wednesday said it expects the economy to grow 1.7% in both 2022 and 2023, down from its March estimate of 2.8% and 2.2%, respectively, according to officials\\' median forecast.\\n\\nAnd it predicts the unemployment rate, now just above a 50-year low at 3.6%, will rise to 3.7% by the end of the year and 3.9% by the end of 2023. It had projected a decline to 3.5%.\\n\\nEconomic output increased 5.7% last year, the most since 1984, on a reopening economy, increasing COVID vaccinations and massive federal aid to households.\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s bolder rate-hike strategy is an acknowledgement it\\'s now more willing to tolerate rising unemployment and the risk of recession to corral inflation, Barclays says. Last month, Powell and other Fed officials said the job market was so vibrant they likely could steer the economy to a \"soft landing\" of moderately slowing growth that keeps unemployment stable while taming inflation.\\n\\nBut while the labor market is still robust, adding about 400,000 jobs a month in recent months, the economy has already begun pulling back, both because of soaring inflation and rising interest rates. A measure of business investment rose less than expected in April. The Commerce Department said Wednesday that retail sales fell 0.3% in May. And higher mortgage rates are cooling the housing market.\\n\\nNormally, the Fed nudges up rates to contain inflation. But it now runs the risk that big rate increase will topple an already-slowing economy into recession by next year.\\n\\nSome economists believe the Fed is going too far. Inflation is likely to slow as supply chain troubles continue to ease and more Americans return to the work force, relieving workers shortages and rapid wage growth.\\n\\n\"Our objection to this more aggressive (Fed) action is that it is unnecessary because the forces which have driven the recent inflation numbers are already fading,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients.\\n\\nThe Fed has been forced into its hard-nosed strategy because it underestimated inflation\\'s staying power through most of last year. Officials believed skyrocketing prices would retreat quickly as supply problems resolved and consumer purchases sparked by the recovery from the COVID downturn returned to normal. Russia\\'s war on Ukraine and the Delta variant, in part, disrupted that scenario.\\n\\nFed officials were more intent on supporting the recovering economy and ensuring Americans came back to a favorable job market than on curbing inflation.\\n\\nThe central bank on Wednesday also said it has started shedding the trillions of dollars in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities it has amassed to lower long-term rates.\\n\\nRather than sell the bonds outright, which could disrupt markets, the Fed plans to gradually trim its holdings by not reinvesting the proceeds from some of the assets as they mature.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks to reporters after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in an emergency move designed to shield the world\\'s largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus, during a news conference in Washington, March 3, 2020.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday launched its biggest broadside yet against inflation, raising benchmark interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point in a move that equates to the most aggressive hike since 1994.\\n\\nEnding weeks of speculation, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee took the level of its benchmark funds rate to a range of 1.5%-1.75%, the highest since just before the Covid pandemic began in March 2020.\\n\\nAdditionally, members indicated a much stronger path of rate increases ahead to arrest inflation moving at its fastest pace going back to December 1981, according to one commonly cited measure.\\n\\nAccording to the \"dot plot\" of individual members\\' expectations, the Fed\\'s benchmark rate will end the year at 3.4%, an upward revision of 1.5 percentage points from the March estimate. The committee then sees the rate rising to 3.8% in 2023, a full percentage point ramp higher.\\n\\nOfficials also significantly cut their outlook for 2022 economic growth, now anticipating just a 1.7% gain in GDP, down from 2.8% from March.\\n\\nThe inflation projection as gauged by personal consumption expenditures also rose to 5.2% this year from 4.3%, though core inflation, which excludes rapidly rising food and energy costs, is indicated at 4.3%, up just 0.2 percentage points from the previous projection. Core PCE inflation ran at 4.9% in May, so the projections Wednesday anticipate an easing of price pressures in coming months.\\n\\nThe committee\\'s statement painted a largely optimistic picture of the economy even with higher inflation.\\n\\n\"Overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter,\" the statement said. \"Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.\"\\n\\nIndeed, the estimates as expressed through the committee\\'s summary of economic projections see inflation moving sharply lower in 2023, down to 2.6% headline and 2.7% core, projections little changed from March.\\n\\nLonger-term, the committee outlook for policy largely matches market projections which see a series of increases ahead that would take the funds rate to about 3.8%, its highest level since late 2007.\\n\\nThe statement was approved by all FOMC members except for Kansas City Fed President Esther George, who preferred a smaller half-point increase.\\n\\nBanks use the rate as a benchmark for what the charge each other for short-term borrowing. However, it feeds directly through to a multitude of consumer debt products, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, credit cards and auto loans.\\n\\nThe funds rate also can drive rates on savings accounts and CDs higher, though the feed-through on that generally takes longer.\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s move comes with inflation running at its fastest pace in more than 40 years. Central bank officials use the funds rate to try to slow down the economy - in this case to tamp down demand so that supply can catch up.\\n\\nHowever, the post-meeting statement removed a long-used phrase indicating that the FOMC \"expects inflation to return to its 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong.\" The statement only noted that the Fed \"is strongly committed\" to the goal.\\n\\nThe policy tightening is happening with economic growth already tailing off while prices still rise, a condition known as stagflation.\\n\\nFirst-quarter growth declined at a 1.5% annualized pace, and an updated estimate Wednesday from the Atlanta Fed, through its GDPNow tracker, put the second quarter as flat. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth is a widely used rule of thumb to delineate a recession.\\n\\nFed officials engaged in a public bout of hand-wringing heading into Wednesday\\'s decision.\\n\\nFor weeks, policymakers had been insisting that half-point - or 50-basis-point - increases could help arrest inflation. In recent days, though, CNBC and other media outlets reported that conditions were ripe for the Fed to go beyond that. The changed approach came even though Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in May had insisted that hiking by 75 basis points was not being considered.\\n\\nHowever, a recent series of alarming signals triggered the more aggressive action.\\n\\nInflation as measured by the consumer price index rose 8.6% on a yearly basis in May. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey hit an all-time low that included sharply higher inflation expectations. Also, retail sales numbers released Wednesday confirmed that the all-important consumer is weakening, with sales dropping 0.3% for a month in which inflation rose 1%.\\n\\nThe jobs market has been a point of strength for the economy, though May\\'s 390,000 gain was the lowest since April 2021. Average hourly earnings have been rising in nominal terms, but when adjusted for inflation have fallen 3% over the past year.\\n\\nThe committee projections released Wednesday see the unemployment rate, currently at 3.6%, moving up to 4.1% by 2024.\\n\\nAll of those factors have combined to complicate Powell\\'s hopes for a \"soft or softish\" landing that he expressed in May.

       "  'body': 'The pullback in spending is another indicator showing the economy is losing momentum as the Federal Reserve takes action to raise interest rates and combat historically high inflation.\\n\\nConsumer spending, buoyed by strong job growth and stimulus measures, was the backbone of the country\\'s economic recovery since a brief recession occurred in early 2020. That strength is fading in the face of the strongest pace of inflation in four decades. \"Now consumers are planning to take a back seat,\" said Beth Ann Bovino, U.S. chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. \"How far they\\'re planning to sit back -- it\\'s still an open question.\"\\n\\nA sharp drop in vehicle sales -- due to high prices, low inventory and rising interest rates on car loans -- played an outsize role in the decline in month-over-month retail spending. Consumers also pulled back their spending on goods such as furniture, electronics and online purchases.\\n\\nHigher borrowing costs are hitting the housing market as well, with the National Association of Home Builders reporting Wednesday that confidence among home builders in the U.S. decreased in June for the sixth consecutive month.\\n\\nMore broadly, monthly job gains slowed in May, as did annual wage increases. Consumer spending eased in April and the saving rate fell to the lowest in 14 years, suggesting many Americans are tapping savings to offset cost increases from inflation.\\n\\nThe weaker-than-expected retail sales in May and a downward revision to April spending prompted some economists to downgrade their expectations for economic growth in the second quarter. The economy contracted in the first quarter.\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts lowered their forecast for U.S. gross domestic product growth to an annual rate of 2.5% in the second quarter from 3.25% previously. Data firm IHS Markit cut its growth estimate to 0.9%.\\n\\nExcluding autos and gasoline, retail sales rose just 0.1% in May, well behind the pace at which prices increased last month. Unlike other reports compiled by the government, retail sales aren\\'t adjusted for inflation. Soaring gasoline and grocery prices meant households shelled out more on them in May -- Americans are spending over 43% more on gasoline than a year ago and nearly 9% more on groceries.\\n\\nRetail sales were up 8.1% last month from a year earlier, a robust gain but below the blistering pace of inflation, which was up 8.6% in May from a year earlier, according to the Labor Department\\'s consumer-price index.\\n\\nInterest rates look set to rise further, a potential damper on consumer spending in the months ahead as car loans and credit-card debt get more expensive. Later Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is set to wrap up a two-day policy meeting. A string of troubling inflation reports in recent days is likely to lead Fed officials to consider a larger-than-expected 0.75-percentage-point interest-rate increase.\\n\\nConsumers are getting less for their money due to rapidly rising prices. The dynamic is also driving a shift from discretionary purchases such as furniture and electronics to essentials like food and gasoline.\\n\\nThe average cost of a gallon of regular gasoline exceeded $4.60 a gallon in late May, up from about $3 a gallon a year earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Prices in June have risen above $5 a gallon.\\n\\nLogan CoBell, 33 years old, who works in Chicago as a bartender and substitute teacher, said he is driving only for essential reasons, such as commuting to work, to save money on gasoline. He is watching his spending at the grocery store by cutting down on purchases of red meat and opting for cheaper alternatives such as pork and nonorganic chicken.\\n\\nMr. CoBell said he was holding off on upgrading to a new computer \"so I have cash in hand just in case something weird happens, like another shutdown.\"\\n\\nCompanies are struggling with higher inflation, which they say is increasingly hard to pass on to consumers. Some large retailers such as Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. in recent weeks reported steep profit declines as rising supply-chain, wage and inflation-related costs ate into earnings.\\n\\nInflation and high fuel prices are also taking a toll on consumer confidence. Last week the University of Michigan reported that an index of consumer sentiment dropped in June to its lowest point since the inception of the survey in the late 1940s.\\n\\nBill Stoops, a 72-year old retiree living in San Diego, said the hit to asset values from financial-market turmoil in recent months means he is pulling in some spending.\\n\\n\"We thought about planning a trip to France and Germany, maybe Italy -- we still want to do that but we don\\'t see it for this year at all,\" he said, adding \"I\\'m no longer talking about replacing my current fun car with another fun car.\"\\n\\nConsumers are also continuing to shift spending to services from goods as many Americans resume more in-person activities such as travel and dining out.\\n\\nThe retail sales report mostly covers spending on goods rather than services, but it said that receipts at bars and restaurants were up 0.7% in May, a sign that Americans are continuing to dine out.\\n\\nConsumer spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic output. A strong labor market and rising wages have helped support spending on services, for which there is pent-up demand from the pandemic.\\n\\nCraig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a research and consulting firm, said he anticipates a slowdown in retail spending.\\n\\n\"We\\'re in a little bit of a watershed in terms of what\\'s going to happen to the economy,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"The American consumer -- she\\'s very resilient, but she\\'s not infinitely resilient.',\n",

       "  'body': 'WASHINGTON, June 15 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden\\'s top officials and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were quick to dismiss the first embers of inflation in the spring of 2021 in a single word: Transitory.\\n\\nMore than a year later, price increases at 40-year peaks have proven to be anything but, so much so that the Fed this week appears ready to hike interest rates by the most since 1994 to quell them. Biden, meanwhile, is paying the political price for being the face Americans blame for $5 a gallon gas and 10% price increases for eggs.\\n\\nIn truth, the culprits contributing to the current U.S. inflation are numerous. Fiscal spending likely went a step too far; a red-hot job market lifted worker pay the most in a generation; global supply shocks kept coming instead of easing; the war in Ukraine created food and fuel scarcities.\\n\\nBut both the Fed and Biden administration were slow to shift their focus from fighting the economic shock of the pandemic, particularly on employment, to controlling inflation that is so acute the central bank is willing to court a recession to fix it.\\n\\nBy mid-summer 2021, the pandemic employment hole was still nearly 7 million jobs, but price increases were already running at their highest in a decade and twice the Fed\\'s 2% a year target. Biden and Powell each referred to \"transitory\" inflation within days of each other that July. Biden did so in a speech marking his first six months in office and Powell in his press conference following that month\\'s Fed policy meeting.\\n\\nBy September, the Fed appeared to finally take note, when it signaled the labor market conditions it had set for dialing back its bond purchases - the first step toward higher rates - would soon be met. The consumer price index then had climbed by more than 5% year-on-year, belying expectations for an easing.\\n\\nWhen the Fed actually started reducing its asset purchases in November it would be north of 6%.\\n\\nConsumers noticed as well. A measure of near-term inflation expectations from the University of Michigan that month hit its highest since 2008.\\n\\nThat presented the first inklings of a new and deeper problem.\\n\\nHigh inflation becoming rooted in public psychology is something Fed officials have feared as it lowers obstacles for companies to raise prices, keeps consumers spending furiously, and undermines the Fed\\'s own credibility as an inflation fighter.\\n\\nIndeed, that risk - which has only grown this year - is now central to the rapid change in the Fed\\'s posture. read more \"As soon as (inflation) expectations move, you have to hit like a hammer. Do more and do it quick. That is where we are,\" said Larry Meyer, a former Fed governor and chief executive of LHMeyer, referring to the prospect of a three quarter point Fed rate hike this week.\\n\\nFor its part, the White House in mid-2021 created a task force to deal with supply chain snarls, thick with retail and logistics company leaders, tried to stamp down rising oil prices with releases from the strategic petroleum reserve and focused on anti-competitive practices in key industries.\\n\\nIn December, Biden declared victory over empty shelves, seconded by FedEx Corp (FDX.N) chief executive Fred Smith.\\n\\nBut inflation did not respond, prompting Biden in the fall to double down on his big plan to fix it. The Build Back Better Act aimed hundreds of billions of dollars in investment at reducing health care, housing, childcare and prescription drug costs, among other issues.\\n\\nInstead, it died in Congress after negotiations failed between the White House, and progressive Democrats and hold out senators.\\n\\nBy May of this year, Biden was highlighting the role the Fed, not the White House, would play in reducing inflation, while promising to look at tariffs on goods from China and other issues that could have some impact.\\n\\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen, a key promoter of the term \"transitory,\" publicly retired it in December, but she continued to reassure White House officials privately early this year that price pressures would ease in 2022. It was not until this month that she admitted her mistake. read more\\n\\nWhite House officials now privately acknowledge they may have little control over price hikes ahead of the crucial November mid-terms, and would do what they could on the margins, while continuing to lay the blame on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine that sent fuel and food costs sky-rocketing further. read more\\n\\nOnce Fed officials this year fully embraced that the situation had changed, their response took on increasing urgency as the clamor grew from financial market actors and other critics that they were woefully behind the curve.\\n\\nThey accelerated the end of their bond purchases and in March raised the benchmark short term federal funds rate for the first time since 2018, by a quarter percentage point.\\n\\nBut even then, policymakers\\' projections signaled what, by historical standards, would be a modest rise in the federal funds rate to around 1.9% by the end of the year, with no change in unemployment from the current low rate of 3.6%.\\n\\nIn early May, they raised rates again, by half a point this time, and for weeks afterward touted a plan to raise them by that margin again at meetings in June and July.\\n\\nSince then, the outlook on prices has eroded further, with annual consumer inflation as of May accelerating to 8.6%, and persistently high prices now amounting to a generational shock. Stock markets have sunk into a full-on bear market on worries that the Fed\\'s small steps will no longer be enough, and bond yields most sensitive to central bank policy expectations have shot to their highest since 2007.\\n\\nWhen data on Friday showed a jump in consumers\\' expectations about inflation, coupled with a similar outcome in a Monday New York Fed survey, it may have convinced Fed officials that their pledge to tame prices had not yet registered - to either the public or financial markets. read more\\n\\nJason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and a Harvard University professor, said Fed officials were paying the price for policy that promised to fight inflation but lacked any firm commitment to push rates to restrictive levels.\\n\\n\"It is hard to convince people you are going to do serious things next year when you are not going to do them this year,\" he said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'This article is an on-site version of our Unhedged newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday\\n\\nGood morning. The latest leg of the sell-off, which has taken us into a bear market, has been shocking in velocity but familiar in structure. More on that, and on the worsening mess in crypto, below. Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com.\\n\\nFriday morning\\'s inflation report was a surprise. The market response to it stuck to the standard script. In conceptual, if not temporal order, what happened was as follows:\\n\\nFirst, expectations for rate increases changed, a lot. A week ago, the futures market implied a 3 per cent chance of a 75 basis point increase, and a 97 per cent chance of a 50 point increase, when the Fed meets later this week. Now the odds are 28/72. The market implied fed funds rate for February 2023 has moved from 3.1 to 3.9 per cent.\\n\\nNext, the Treasury curve moved, a lot. Rates leap at all maturities, but fastest at two and five years, flattening the belly of the curve.\\n\\nNext, equities fell, a lot. The S&P dropped 6.8 per cent over two days. Everything went down, but value fell less than growth, and big caps fell less than small caps. Here is the sectoral breakdown:\\n\\nNote the familiar pattern: the growths stuff that did so well in the coronavirus pandemic sold off the hardest (the consumer discretionary sector is 43 per cent weighted to Amazon and Tesla).\\n\\nWe have seen all of this before, more or less every other time the inflation data has come in hot. Indeed, most of the S&P down days seem to follow this sort of pattern. Rate expectations up, stocks down, yields up, yesterday\\'s winners become today\\'s losers.\\n\\nA question remains, though. Is this an inflation scare, a Fed-induced recession scare, or some of both?\\n\\nThe market provides a few useful, if inconclusive, clues. First, break-even inflation has not moved much. The big jump in five-year Treasury yields, for example, has been mirrored by the jump in five-year inflation-protected Treasury (Tips) yields, leaving implied inflation flat:\\n\\nWe\\'ve argued in the past that Tips yields are probably a distorted indicator of investor expectations. Still, this chart is probably telling you something, directionally at least. It may be saying, \"The Fed is going to raise rates, but inflation will not get out of control.\" Or it may be saying, \"Inflation volatility is going up, so real rates have to rise to reflect that risk.\" Probably it is some of both. But either way, it is not screaming that inflation is going higher.\\n\\nNext, consider corporate bonds\\' yield spreads over Treasuries. They have been moving higher, and in a specific way. The spread between spreads has been increasing. That is, lower-quality bonds are seeing their spreads move higher faster than higher-quality bonds.\\n\\nBelow is the difference between investment-grade spreads and spreads just of the lowest rung of investment grade, or BBBs; the difference between BBB and the highest grade of junk bond, or single Bs; and between single Bs and the lowest grade of junk, of CCCs:\\n\\nWhen the spread between spreads widens like this, that is telling you the economy is going to get worse and defaults are going to rise. These data only go through Friday, but a reliable bond trader contact said these gaps kept right on widening.\\n\\nBoth of these points suggest that the market is primarily afraid that the Fed will tighten the economy into recession, rather than fearing that inflation will spin out of control. But on the other hand, if inflation was not a worry, you might expect the 10-year Treasury to catch a bid, rather than selling off hard. And you wouldn\\'t expect Fed fund futures to rise so sharply. So the picture is mixed. Recession is the primary risk, but the chances of a recession accompanied by high inflation -- stagflation -- are moving up too.\\n\\nOne month ago, falling crypto prices caused a badly designed stablecoin, TerraUSD, to fall apart. It was one of the most popular projects in decentralised finance -- blockchain\\'s answer to the financial services industry. Capital began fleeing DeFi. Friday\\'s inflation scare further intensified the crypto sell-off. Then, yesterday, something else broke:\\n\\nBinance on Monday halted withdrawals of bitcoin for several hours after crypto lender Celsius also blocked customers from pulling funds from its platform, citing \"extreme market conditions\"\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\n\\nCelsius is one of the biggest players in the market for digital yield products, providing users with the ability to lend out their tokens as collateral for other crypto projects. In return for lending their tokens, traders were able to earn annual yields of as much as 17 per cent\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009.\\n\\nThe value of assets deposited on Celsius\\'s platform shrivelled to less than $12bn as of May 17 from more than $24bn in late December.\\n\\nCelsius is a (centralised) crypto lending service -- that is to say, an unregulated bank for speculators and market makers. Its capital comes from crypto deposits, drawn in by the promise of double-digit yields. These deposits are then lent out to traders.\\n\\nPeople liked earning a 17 per cent yield when times were good, but times are now bad. Celsius, it seems, did not have enough money on hand to meet all redemptions, so it halted them. In other words, Celsius is cash flow insolvent. A widely circulated note on Monday claimed it could run out of funds in five weeks.\\n\\nThis could matter beyond Celsius. It invests widely in DeFi. Larry Cermak at The Block estimates its current holdings at $1.4bn, spread across several DeFi protocols and cryptocurrencies. The company behind tether has also extended a loan to Celsius, collateralised in bitcoin. In April, Celsius boasted of holding 150,000 bitcoin, a bigger stake than even Michael Saylor\\'s MicroStrategy. If Celsius fails, crypto will take several hard punches to the face.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Binance, the biggest crypto exchange, happened to have a three-hour outage around the same time the Celsius news dropped. The exchange blamed technical issues, as it has had in the past.\\n\\nThe FT\\'s Katie Martin thinks there could be something more going on. She made the point to us yesterday that we might have entered the \"who is left holding the baby phase of the crypto crisis\". That is, the crash has gone from hurting crypto holders to threatening crypto institutions.\\n\\nAre her suspicions correct? A true crisis could develop if Binance et al have significant hidden exposure to declining prices, perhaps through DeFi investments. That aside, though, the exchanges\\' value simply depends on trading volume, which has fallen a long way since 2021. Coinbase\\'s stock is down 85 per cent from its IPO because it is a volatile business that is shrinking at the moment, not because it faces a Celsius-like liquidity crunch. Chances are the exchanges will hang on as long as people want to pay fees to trade crypto.\\n\\nA cascading crisis that brings down the biggest crypto institutions is possible.

       "  'body': 'WASHINGTON, June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in May as motor vehicle purchases declined amid shortages, and record high gasoline prices pulled spending away from other goods.\\n\\nRetail sales dropped 0.3% last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Data for April was revised lower to show sales increasing 0.7% instead of 0.9% as previously reported.

       "  'body': 'New projections showed all 18 officials who participated in the meeting expect the Fed to raise rates to at least 3% this year, with at least half of all officials indicating the fed-funds rate might need to rise to around 3.375% this year.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not trying to induce a recession now. Let\\'s be clear about that,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference.\\n\\nBut he said it was becoming more difficult to achieve what is known as a soft landing, in which the economy slows enough to bring down inflation while avoiding a recession. That represented an implicit concession that the risks of a downturn could rise as the economy digests tighter monetary policy.\\n\\n\"It is not going to be easy,\" Mr. Powell said. \"There\\'s a much bigger chance now that it\\'ll depend on factors that we don\\'t control. Fluctuations and spikes in commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands.\"\\n\\nThe S&P 500 rose 54.51 points, or 1.5%, to 3789.99, snapping a five-day losing streak. U.S. government bonds rallied after sliding in recent weeks in a selloff that had pushed yields to their highest levels in more than a decade.\\n\\nLast week, the Labor Department reported the consumer-price index rose 8.6% in May, driven by higher energy prices. Rising fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions from Russia\\'s war against Ukraine have sent prices up in recent months.\\n\\nMr. Powell\\'s comments indicated that the Fed \"will have to keep jamming on the brakes even if growth struggles, and the market didn\\'t get it,\" said Priya Misra, head of interest-rate strategy at TD Securities.\\n\\nMs. Misra warned that markets would face higher volatility until inflation is clearly diminishing. \"Today, everyone is cheering, but if inflation has not peaked, we will have to go through the stress of the last few days all over again,\" she said.\\n\\nThe Fed has faced growing criticism in recent weeks for not acting sooner to withdraw aggressive stimulus it deployed through most of last year. \"Powell took a bold decision today, and it sends the kind of message the economy needs to hear,\" said Rep. French Hill (R., Ark).\\n\\nExpectations of a larger rate rise and a higher path of rate rises had convulsed bond markets in recent days. Over the five days through Tuesday, the two-year Treasury yield had climbed by 0.7 percentage point, the largest such increase since 1982, according to JPMorgan Chase.\\n\\nWednesday\\'s rate increase marked an abrupt change from unusually precise guidance delivered by many members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, who had indicated in recent weeks that they would raise rates by a smaller half percentage point, as officials did at their meeting last month.\\n\\nMr. Powell said the committee had decided to approve the larger rate rise because of concerns over recent data on inflation and expectations of future inflation, which economists say play a significant role influencing actual price rises. Mr. Powell said officials decided it didn\\'t make sense to wait until July to move to a larger rate increase.\\n\\nThe committee vote was 10-1, with Kansas City Fed President Esther George dissenting in favor of a half-percentage-point, or 50-basis-point, increase.\\n\\n\"Clearly, today\\'s 75-basis-point increase is an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common,\" Mr. Powell said. \"From the perspective of today, either a 50-basis-point or a 75-basis-point increase seems most likely at our next meeting\" on July 26-27.\\n\\nWednesday\\'s rate increase returns the Fed\\'s benchmark rate to its level in early March 2020, before the Fed slashed it to near zero as the Covid-19 pandemic hit the U.S. economy But interest rates in the U.S. and many other wealthy nations remain at very low levels historically.\\n\\nMr. Powell said he expected the central bank would raise rates to levels designed to slow the economy. \"We think that policy is going to need to be restrictive, and we don\\'t know how restrictive,\" he said.\\n\\nAt the same time, Mr. Powell said he saw no signs of a broader slowdown in the economy. \"You\\'re seeing continuing shifts in consumption...but overall spending is very strong,\" he said.\\n\\nWednesday\\'s projections showed officials see the fed-funds rate peaking at around 3.75% by the end of 2023, up from the 2.75% rate that officials projected in March but slightly below what interest-rate futures markets had anticipated earlier this week.\\n\\nSuch a pace of increases would nevertheless represent the most aggressive rate-rise cycle since the 1980s. The central bank has also initiated a program to withdraw stimulus by shrinking its $8.9 trillion asset portfolio through attrition; the Fed is passively reducing its holdings as those securities mature.\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s monetary-policy statement removed a line that, in May, had indicated officials expected inflation to return to 2% and for the labor market to remain strong as it raised rates. Mr. Powell said the removal of that sentence reflected the sense that the Fed couldn\\'t reduce inflation to 2% by itself while maintaining a strong labor market.\\n\\n\"The worst mistake we could make would be to fail\" to bring down inflation, Mr. Powell said. \"It\\'s not an option. We have to restore price stability.\"\\n\\nThe projections revealed that all but one official expect the unemployment rate to rise over the next two years, an implicit acknowledgment of rising recession risks. The median projection showed the unemployment rate, which stood at 3.6% in May, ending at 3.7% this year before rising to 4.1% in 2024.\\n\\n\"Powell told us policy is going to create a recession, but soft-peddled it enough to leave markets to figure that out for themselves,\" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard.\\n\\nThe fed-funds rate, an overnight rate on lending between banks, influences other consumer and business borrowing costs throughout the economy, including rates on mortgages, credit cards, saving accounts, car loans and corporate debt. Raising rates typically restrains spending, while cutting rates encourages such borrowing.\\n\\nThe U.S. mortgage market has been slammed by the prospect of tighter money, and many lenders were quoting a 30-year fixed rate above 6% on Monday and Tuesday, levels that haven\\'t been reached since 2008. Two large real-estate brokerages announced layoffs on Tuesday as home-purchase demand has stalled.\\n\\nMortgage rates stood near 3% at the beginning of the year. \"You can\\'t double mortgage rates in a six-month span and live to tell about it,\" said Lou Barnes, a mortgage banker in Boulder, Colo., who expected housing to go through a sharp slowdown. \"At 6%-plus, mortgages will be very painful.\"\\n\\nThe Commerce Department reported Wednesday that U.S. retail sales -- a measure of spending at stores, online and in restaurants -- fell a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in May from the previous month. That was the first decline in month-over-month retail spending this year. Monthly job gains slowed in May, as did annual wage increases.\\n\\nMarkets began to anticipate the larger 0.75-percentage point increase after a disappointing inflation report on Friday, and again after The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that such a move might occur on Wednesday.\\n\\nSome former Fed economists said the central bank risked sparking greater market volatility after the surprising shift to a larger rate rise. \"It raises questions of whether they\\'re in control of the situation. It is panicky,\" said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Dreyfus and Mellon \"It will be extremely difficult for them to control the narrative after doing 75 basis points.\"\\n\\nOthers said they viewed Mr. Powell\\'s decision as a sign that he was more committed to bring down inflation even if it risked a downturn. \"If he\\'s willing to blow up carefully laid plans to deliver a hawkish surprise, we should take him at his word that he will stay the course,\" said Ellen Meade, who retired from the Fed last August as a senior policy adviser.\\n\\nCorrections & Amplifications\\n\\nKansas City Fed President Esther George dissented in favor of a 50-basis-point increase.

       "  'body': 'MUMBAI (Reuters) - As India faces a crippling surge in food and fuel prices, its policymakers will be counting mostly on this year\\'s monsoon rains, not just interest rate hikes, to take inflationary pressure off the country\\'s households and businesses.\\n\\nLike its international peers, the Reserve Bank of India is expected raise rates aggressively over the next year to take some of the heat out of prices, but the global drivers of the country\\'s inflation mean there are limits to what domestic monetary policy can achieve, analysts say.\\n\\nWith 75% of India\\'s price acceleration expected to come from food items, the focus for central bankers will be on the success of monsoon rains to boost production and replenish stockpiles, which would ease supply constraints and anchor price expectations.\\n\\n\"Will monetary policy action will be able to contain (food inflation)? Very honestly, it will not,\" said Indranil Pan, chief economist at Yes Bank. \"It will at best contain the second round implications and arrest the inflation expectations from moving on the higher side.\"\\n\\nIndia\\'s retail prices rose 7.04% in May year-on-year, data showed on Monday, slowing slightly from April\\'s eight-year peak but still above the RBI\\'s 2%-to-6% target band for a fifth straight.\\n\\n(Graphic on, India\\'s WPI and CPI inflation: )\\n\\nCurrent price increases, if sustained, would pile pressure on the government and more pressingly the central bank, which is politically accountable for extended breaches of the target band.\\n\\nFood and fuel are the two main sources of inflation in India and prices of most food items have shot up in recent months due to supply disruptions caused by Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, erratic weather and export curbs.\\n\\nIndia meets two-thirds of its vegetable oil demand through imports. Sunflower oil imports from the Black Sea region have been crippled by the war while palm oil supplies have been hampered by Indonesia\\'s export curbs.\\n\\n\"Until supplies are restored in the world market, prices will not come down to normal levels,\" said B.V. Mehta, executive director of Solvent Extractors\\' Association of India.\\n\\nThis puts the burden on domestic production with hopes pinned on a normal monsoon season that could ease food prices in the second half of the fiscal year ending March 2023.\\n\\nBut so far, rainfalls in the season starting June 1 are 36% lower than average.\\n\\n\"Vegetable prices jumped in the last few weeks as a heat wave damaged crops,\" said Mahesh Shinde, a Pune-based vegetable trader. \"Now below-normal monsoon rainfall is delaying planting.\"\\n\\nIndia\\'s monsoon is crucial for its farm output and economic growth, with just over half of arable land fed by rain.\\n\\nIf this year\\'s monsoon disappoints, analysts believe the government will have limited fiscal space to arrest prices.\\n\\nThe government last month restricted wheat and sugar exports and announced a series of changes to commodity tax structures to insulate consumers.\\n\\n\"The RBI foresees inflation staying above 6% in the first three quarters of this fiscal, amounting to four straight quarters of above-target reading,\" said D. K. Joshi, chief economist at rating agency CRISIL.\\n\\n\"If the barometer stays above target for three consecutive quarters, the RBI is obliged to explain to the government\".\\n\\nWhile a good monsoon would bring some price relief, it is a factor the central bank has no control over.\\n\\nThe world\\'s fifth-largest and second-most populous economy has a troubled history with inflation: price surges have created social and political instability in the past that the Modi government will be keen to avoid.\\n\\nAuthorities were able to keep wheat and rice prices down, defying a global spike, thanks to a pandemic-era foodgrain distribution scheme.\\n\\nHowever, with that programme scheduled to end in September - and grain stocks now down nearly 29% from a year ago - wheat prices could surge, a Mumbai-based dealer with a global firm said.\\n\\n(Graphic on, India wheat prices: )\\n\\nCompounding that problem, the government\\'s wheat purchases from farmers have more than halved this year after heat-waves slashed output.\\n\\nAll of that risks reviving the kind of price pressures that have troubled politicians and bureaucrats in the past.\\n\\nIndia\\'s Congress party, which ruled the country most of the time since independence in 1947, lost power in the 2014 general elections mainly due to double digit inflation and corruption charges.\\n\\n\"Inflation measured by various indices can be an abstract concept for consumers, but food and fuel inflation hit people\\'s pocketbooks practically every day,\" said Amitabh Dubey, a political analyst at research company TS Lombard.\\n\\n\"Indian political history shows that food inflation has an immediate and visceral impact on the political mood and is something the Modi government has to take very seriously.\"',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Federal Reserve on Wednesday hiked interest rates by the most since 1994 in an effort to tamp down inflation that\\'s hitting Americans on every front.\\n\\nThe average price at the gas pump is now over $5 a gallon, airline fares were up 12.6% from April to May, and the food index rose 10.1% year-over-year in May. Unfortunately, personal finance guru Suze Orman, co-founder of SecureSave and host of the \"Women & Money\" podcast, has more bad news.\\n\\nInflation is \"here to stay for quite a while,\" Orman told Yahoo Finance\\'s editor-in-chief, Andy Serwer, on Monday in a wide-ranging interview for his \"Influencers\" series. To mask soaring inflation, Orman suggests that companies will \"shrink their packaging,\" so even if consumers pay the same price for goods, they are effectively getting less in value.\\n\\n\"So you\\'re paying the same price, but you\\'re getting less in terms of what you\\'re really paying for. Do you really think when this goes away, Andy, that they\\'re going to make their boxes bigger again? I don\\'t think so,\" Orman says.\\n\\nInflation hit a 40-year high in May, but not every expert believes prices will keep surging. Alan Blinder, former vice chair of the Federal Reserve and a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, predicted in a June 1 op-ed for The Wall Street Journal that the U.S. will not be \"doomed to high inflation for years.\" He anticipates that supply-chain problems will soon ease and that volatile components of inflation, such as food and energy, will also settle down in the near future.\\n\\n\"Inflation will fall as quickly and dramatically as it rose,\" Blinder wrote.\\n\\nStill, this could provide little comfort to Americans whose wages aren\\'t currently keeping up with the fast pace of inflation. In an era of higher prices, Orman advises consumers to have self-discipline and to be more frugal than they would be in a less inflationary environment.\\n\\n\"When corporations find that they can make a fortune off of us, which they are, look at the oil companies, then you have got to understand that it\\'s really important that you adjust how you spend your money -- and how much you spend versus how much you save,\" she said. \"The simple answer to this is you all have to save more and spend less.\"\\n\\nOrman also warns consumers to rein in credit card spending. Indeed, the Federal Reserve reported in May that U.S. credit card balances were $71 billion higher in the first quarter of 2022 than the same quarter the year prior.\\n\\n\"You\\'re watching credit card debt build up higher than it\\'s been in a long, long time,\" Orman notes.\\n\\nAmericans already appear to be pulling back on their discretionary spending. The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that retail sales fell 0.3% in May, the first decline recorded in five months. For her part, Orman recommends cutting back on non-essential expenses as long as inflation continues to rise, even though it might be tempting to hit the town and spend money as COVID-19 eases.\\n\\n\"You have to just do what you need versus what you want to do,\" she said. \"And that really is the key to getting through this.\"',\n",

       " {'title': \"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's First Year on the Job: Undoing Bezos-Led Overexpansion\",\n",
       "  'body': 'Amid one of the worst stretches for financial performance in Amazon\\'s history, Mr. Jassy is working to cut back the excesses of an e-commerce operation the company expanded at breakneck pace during much of the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, he\\'s trying to resuscitate languishing sales in that business and drive growth in other divisions.\\n\\nMuch of his effort is aimed at reversing course on e-commerce initiatives put in place under his mentor, Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, before he handed over the reins last July.\\n\\n\"Following all that growth that we had in the short term, we have some things [Mr. Jassy] felt we need to do to get right in the business,\" said Patty Stonesifer, an Amazon board member since 1997. \"And so he\\'s working on the supply, the labor and delivery speeds. He\\'s right in the middle of it.\"\\n\\nMr. Bezos and other executives had greenlighted a strategy, guided by a revered internal forecasting tool, that overshot the long-term projections for demand from Amazon. Instead, despite early ideas among industry observers about a permanent shift in consumer behavior, the pandemic-fueled growth in online shopping has slowed as in-person shopping has bounced back.\\n\\nEarly in the pandemic, Amazon saw a pivotal moment to meet demand and expand its e-commerce reach. Under its founder, it opened hundreds of new warehouses, sorting centers and other logistics facilities, and doubled its workforce from 2020 through March, to more than 1.6 million people.\\n\\nThat helped the business for a time -- Amazon was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic tech boom. Its revenue grew by a total of two-thirds across 2020 and 2021, and its profit nearly tripled. But demand hasn\\'t kept pace with that planned capacity, and its setback has been among the most pronounced.\\n\\nThe disconnect was a major drag on earnings this year -- Amazon signaled the excess space would contribute to $10 billion in extra costs in the first half of 2022. The company\\'s stock price has fallen by more than a third during Mr. Jassy\\'s tenure, erasing more than $600 billion in market value.\\n\\nNow, Mr. Jassy and his team are working to sublease at least 10 million square feet of excess warehouse space, defer construction of new facilities on land Amazon has bought and find ways to end or renegotiate leases with outside warehouse owners. He has closed down much of the company\\'s bricks-and-mortar retail operation -- 68 stores -- and is looking to pare back its head count.\\n\\n\"For this moment in our corporate history, he\\'s perfect,\" said Amazon board member Jamie Gorelick in an interview.\\n\\nMr. Jassy\\'s new focus is proving in some ways harder than rapid growth. He already has lost one key lieutenant, Dave Clark, a 23-year veteran who had been appointed to run the consumer business just 18 months earlier.\\n\\nThe two men had worked closely together on efforts to fix the retail business, including an updated plan that Mr. Clark presented to the board last month. Days after the presentation, Mr. Clark resigned, saying on Twitter, \"I\\'ve had an incredible time at Amazon but it\\'s time for me to build again.\" According to people close to Mr. Clark, he was also tired of Mr. Jassy\\'s day-to-day, hands-on style of managing.\\n\\nOther retailers also have been caught off guard by the pandemic\\'s shifting effects on shopping. And Amazon\\'s stumbles are part of a broader setback for the giant tech companies that have soared in power and wealth for much of the past two decades. Companies like Amazon, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. , and Google gained even more strength during the pandemic, as people shifted more of their life and work online. Now their stocks are falling as people return to prepandemic habits, and several are slowing their hiring and taking other measures to tighten belts.\\n\\nAs Covid-19 spread in early 2020, homebound customers turned to Amazon at an unprecedented clip. Orders neared that of the holiday season -- when Amazon typically adds legions of temporary workers to handle demand -- and the company was short-staffed and often out of stock on key items, pushing delivery windows from two days to weeks on some items.\\n\\nMr. Bezos had largely relinquished day-to-day decision making prior to the pandemic as he took on more outside interests. But with the crisis, he dove back into the business, helping guide Amazon\\'s strategy and ensuring that Amazon could meet the surge in demand.\\n\\nPart of Amazon\\'s e-commerce challenges today stem from a piece of technology long prized during Mr. Bezos\\' tenure as a secret weapon, an internal forecasting system called Supply Chain Optimization Technologies, or SCOT. It was designed to incorporate a multitude of factors and spit out projections for product demand and the growth in logistics needed to fulfill it.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s SCOT forecasts produced low, medium and high estimates. Because of unprecedented volume in the early days of the pandemic, Amazon executives including Mr. Clark repeatedly chose the higher end of SCOT\\'s estimates, said people who used the tool and worked on the SCOT team at the time. Those estimates meant that the company needed many more fulfillment centers and other infrastructure to keep up.\\n\\nWhile Mr. Clark\\'s team didn\\'t have a blank check, Mr. Bezos and Amazon\\'s board of directors approved plans to aggressively build out new warehouses and transportation hubs, and go on a hiring spree to get customers their packages.\\n\\n\"A lot of wise people said [that] to meet same-day delivery plus recover from the pandemic, plus address this extraordinary growth and have the customer experience we want, we need more capacity fast, and we held hands and did it,\" said Ms. Stonesifer.\\n\\nIn 27 months, Amazon added about as many employees as the entire workforces of United Parcel Service Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp. combined.\\n\\n\"We made a decision to build to the high side to avoid constraining consumers and sellers in any way,\" said Mr. Jassy at the company\\'s shareholder meeting in May.\\n\\nSenior Amazon executives familiar with the forecasting technology said it wasn\\'t equipped to process an unforeseeable event like the pandemic and caused the company to commit to building out warehouses and infrastructure early in the pandemic that take 18 months to two years to come online. When the virus receded, Amazon was left with more planned capacity than orders.\\n\\nPublicly, Amazon was still riding a pandemic high on July 5, 2021, when Mr. Jassy took over as CEO. Amazon had smashed its earnings report for the quarter ended March 31, with sales rising 44%. Days after he started the new job, the company\\'s stock hit an all-time high. In his own fief, the executive had become accustomed to torrid growth. Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing division that Mr. Jassy had run since its launch in 2006, posted a 32% jump in quarterly sales.\\n\\nMr. Jassy had pioneered the cloud business, and it had long been Amazon\\'s cash cow. It accounted for less than a seventh of total revenue in 2021, but nearly three-quarters of operating profit. Amazon\\'s retail business, and the huge logistics operation it entails, was larger but had a lower profit margin. Amazon also boasts a fast-growing advertising business, among other units.\\n\\nA 25-year veteran of Amazon, Mr. Jassy had long been a member of Amazon\\'s \"S Team\" of top leaders who advised Mr. Bezos. But he knew relatively little about the intricacies of the core, e-commerce side of the business. After taking over last July, he dove into learning the details of the sprawling retail and logistics operations, bringing his trademark obsession with detail.\\n\\nIn meetings with Mr. Clark and other senior leaders, he asked tough questions and immersed himself in learning about each part of Amazon\\'s operations, said people who attended the meetings. They described Mr. Jassy as an \"operator\" who didn\\'t manage from a distance, but instead liked to get into the details of specific issues.\\n\\nA person familiar with Mr. Jassy\\'s thinking said the executive believes Amazon\\'s \"secret sauce\" is that its leadership team \"doesn\\'t fly at 30,000 feet,\" but instead rolls up its sleeves and dives into the details.\\n\\n\"Well, at AWS we did things this way,\" was a common refrain in such meetings that rubbed some leaders the wrong way, said the people who attended. Some teams found that Mr. Jassy often tried to apply things he learned from his AWS days to very different parts of the business, such as logistics, that weren\\'t applicable, they said.\\n\\nCracks in Amazon\\'s retail and logistics operation had actually begun to show before Mr. Jassy\\'s ascendance, and they grew in the ensuing months, but the pattern was unpredictable. As virus cases slowed, shoppers ventured out of their homes, shopping in person. When new variants surged, they went back to relying on e-commerce.\\n\\nBy July 2021, it became clear to Mr. Jassy and Amazon\\'s logistics team that Amazon\\'s capacity was outpacing demand. They made a series of intensifying cutbacks to the plans for capacity growth, said people involved in the decisions. They again cut back capacity growth plans in September and December of 2021.\\n\\nWhile the new CEO was spending his time on Amazon\\'s growth areas -- such as its digital advertising and Prime Video businesses -- his attention focused increasingly on the core retail and logistics operations run by Mr. Clark.\\n\\nMr. Clark liked working with relative autonomy under Mr. Bezos and bristled at being managed closely on a day-to-day basis, according to people close to Mr. Clark.\\n\\nUnder Mr. Bezos, Mr. Clark\\'s team would present its plans to leadership just a few times a year, the people said. Once Mr. Jassy took over, he demanded a weekly metrics review of the consumer business, they said.\\n\\nBefore the Christmas holiday, the Omicron variant began circulating, causing an influx of orders. But Amazon\\'s warehouse workers were also becoming infected. To keep the warehouses humming, Amazon again added more workers, Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said in April.\\n\\nTypically after Christmas, Amazon sheds warehouse workers because volume subsides, but Omicron lasted through February and Amazon couldn\\'t trim its workforce. Once the virus receded in March, order growth slowed, but all of Amazon\\'s warehouse workers, including the ones who had been out on sick leave, were back, creating a drain on productivity and high costs. In the quarter ended March 31, Amazon had added 14,000 workers. After being understaffed for two years, the company was suddenly overstaffed.\\n\\nIn the past couple of months, around a third of Mr. Jassy\\'s time was spent on trying to fix the capacity and staffing issues on the retail side of the business, said people familiar with the CEO\\'s calendar.\\n\\nIn March, Amazon abruptly shut most of its physical retail stores aside from grocery, even though as late as December the unit had a growth plan to nearly double its store footprint, according to people familiar with the plans. In April, the company pulled more than 1,500 jobs it was planning to fill on the corporate side of retail and imposed a fuel and inflation surcharge for some Amazon sellers.\\n\\nThat month, Mr. Clark began working on a three-year plan to get Amazon out of the position it was in, and also return to a prepandemic pledge of one-day shipping. For several weeks, he worked closely with Mr. Jassy, presenting the plan to him and Mr. Olsavsky, the CFO, some of the people said. By this stage, Mr. Clark\\'s team and Mr. Jassy were communicating nearly daily about turning around the logistics and e-commerce arm, some of the people said.\\n\\nOn April 28, Amazon reported its slowest quarterly growth in two decades and its first quarterly loss since 2015. Divisions including AWS and digital ads had continued growing robustly, but Amazon\\'s online store sales fell 3%. The company\\'s stock plummeted on the slow growth and news that Amazon\\'s warehouse capacity and workforce were bloated.\\n\\nSome investors and analysts were growing impatient. A few weeks following earnings, stock pundit Jim Cramer blasted Mr. Jassy on CNBC. \"You have Bezos no longer running Amazon....But I say, please come back to Amazon. That quarter was so horrible and I have to believe if you were there, you wouldn\\'t have just over hired,\" he said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a time to be defensive and focus on cash flow,\" said Hal Reynolds, chief investment officer at Los Angeles Capital Management LLC, an Amazon investor, said. \"Investors are asking, \\'how does [Jassy] grow the bottom line?\\' We need to see better management success and better operating margins.\"\\n\\nAmazon executives said such criticism was misplaced since many of the decisions leading to Amazon\\'s overcapacity problem were made by Mr. Bezos and other senior leaders.\\n\\nOn May 25, Mr. Clark presented his three-year plan to Amazon\\'s directors at a Seattle meeting, telling the board that his team would get Amazon out of the tough spot it was in, said people in attendance.\\n\\nMr. Clark\\'s plan included reducing Amazon\\'s massive warehousing network in the immediate term, thinning out its worker base through attrition and getting back to the operational efficiency Amazon had become synonymous with. The company would work to return to its one-day shipping initiative and cut costs, he said.\\n\\nThe board of directors and Mr. Bezos were enthusiastic about the plan.\\n\\n\"We\\'re very focused on profitability. I\\'m confident we\\'ll get back to a healthy level of profitability in our consumer business,\" Mr. Jassy said at the shareholder meeting the same day. \"We\\'re working really hard on it.\"\\n\\nMr. Clark, though, was tired from more than two years of leading Amazon\\'s most strained business through the pandemic and was also ready for more autonomy. He left the board meeting feeling like he had presented a sound plan for the company that someone else could now execute on, said a person familiar with his thinking.\\n\\nThe following week, a few hours before a scheduled one-on-one meeting with Mr. Jassy, Mr. Clark emailed the CEO his resignation letter, according to senior Amazon executives. Mr. Clark wasn\\'t pushed out, but at their meeting later that day, Mr. Jassy didn\\'t try to persuade him to stay, executives said.\\n\\nThe next week, Mr. Clark was named CEO of Flexport Inc. a digital-focused freight forwarder. Amazon hasn\\'t announced a successor to implement the executive\\'s three-year plan.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The 75-point increase at a single meeting was supposed to signal shock and awe, and it was the Fed\\'s first move of that magnitude since 1994. Mr. Powell also said an increase of between 50 and 75 basis points is likely at its next meeting in July.\\n\\nBut if you look at the Fed\\'s median forecast, the fed-funds interest rate is expected to rise only to 3.4% by the end of this year. That means increases will taper off through the rest of the year, and the Fed predicts a peak of only 3.8% in 2023. The Fed is front-loading its rate increases, but it\\'s still not anticipating that it has to go all that high to beat inflation.\\n\\nNo wonder bond yields retreated Wednesday even as equities rallied. Markets read the Fed\\'s median forecast on Wednesday as less hawkish than Monday\\'s Fed leak to the press about the likely 75-point increase.\\n\\nWill this really be enough to get consumer-price inflation down from 8.6% today to the Fed\\'s target of 2%? Perhaps, but at this rate it\\'s going to take a while. The Fed forecast for its preferred measure of inflation (the personal-consumption expenditure or PCE index) at the end of this year is now 5.2%. But PCE inflation has been more than 6% at an annual rate in recent months, which means inflation would have to fall sharply over the next six months to hit 5.2% for the year. The Fed\\'s forecast that inflation will hit 2.6% in 2023 seems even more unlikely -- unless there\\'s a recession.\\n\\nThe central bankers certainly are optimistic -- which makes us wonder if they still think, down in the bones of their economic models, that inflation really is \"transitory.\" They still seem to believe the main inflationary fault lies with Covid, supply chains and the Ukraine war, not with their monetary policy, so the Fed doesn\\'t have to do all that much monetary tightening.\\n\\nThe Fed\\'s median forecast is also remarkably sunny for the economy, despite rate increases. The forecast has the jobless rate rising to only 3.9% in 2023 from 3.6% today, and GDP growth falling no lower than 1.7%.\\n\\nWe hope Mr. Powell is right that the economy is \"very strong\" and the consumer is in shape to power through higher rates. But the economy shrank 1.4% in the first quarter, and the Atlanta Fed\\'s GDPNow tracker on Wednesday cut its growth forecast in the second quarter to zero. Consumers whacked by inflation and gas prices are reining in their spending, as retail sales fell in May.\\n\\nMr. Powell is sounding the right note when he says price stability is the bedrock of economic growth. But regaining the Fed\\'s inflation-fighting credibility after two years of mistakes will take more than one 75-basis-point increase, and Americans will believe it only when they see it in falling prices.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Market professionals are supposed to be the ones warning the Fed to \"go it slow,\" \"don\\'t break things,\" etc., but the chorus of investors begging the Fed to tighten even further right now is growing.\\n\\nTake hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who yesterday tweeted, \"The [Fed] has allowed inflation to get out of control. Equity and credit markets have therefore lost confidence in the Fed. Market confidence can be restored if the Fed takes aggressive action with 75 bps [rate hikes] tomorrow and in July, and a commitment to continued [tightening] until it is clear that inflation has been tamed.\"\\n\\nHe added, \"And yes, 100 bps tomorrow, in July and thereafter would be better. The sooner the [Fed] can get to a terminal FF rate and thereafter can begin to ease, the sooner the markets can recover.\"\\n\\nBy \"terminal rate,\" Ackman means the level of neutral--or even restrictive--interest rates that is needed to dramatically slow inflation. And the market has had to quickly rethink how high rates need to go because inflation remains so elevated; it now thinks the Fed has to take rates to 4% by the middle of next year, from their current 0.75% to 1% range. Ackman is saying, why not get there--or to at least 2-3%--as quickly as possible.\\n\\nJeffrey Gundlach, of DoubleLine, made a similar remark last night, tweeting, \"The Federal Reserve should raise the Fed Funds rate to 3% tomorrow, in my opinion.\" Again, this is someone who has seen plenty of financial market crises first-hand. He knows how bad liquidity already is in the markets. And he knows the Fed erring on the side of \"caution\" could actually make things a lot worse right now.\\n\\nA friend of mine with a long career in markets made a similar comment to me over the weekend. \"Markets prefer the devil they know over the devil they don\\'t,\" he said. \"An aggressively tightening Fed is a better known commodity than rampant inflation.\" I asked, would markets freak out if Powell took the kind of measures Ackman, Gundlach, and others are calling for? \"Actually, if they did that, equities would massively rally,\" he replied, \"and forward inflation breakevens would collapse.\"\\n\\nShould weaker economic data give the Fed pause right now? Not necessarily. Yes, retail sales dropped this morning. Yes, the Empire Fed regional manufacturing index was weak. But investors are basically chalking up this business cycle as a loss already; far better to shorten it now, conquer inflation, and have a faster, more promising recovery than to let these problems linger chronically, is what they\\'re saying.\\n\\nAfter all, the deep Volcker recession of 1981-82 was the worst postwar drop since the Great Depression; but as inflation finally ebbed, it was followed by such a strong recovery that President Reagan was reelected with the biggest electoral college landslide ever by 1984. A similarly sharp downturn now might not spare President Biden a midterm loss, but it could set up much more promisingly for his 2024 reelection than a years-long period of stagflation.\\n\\nMonetary policy, remember, works with \"long and variable lags.\" Even the most aggressive tightening today will take a year or more to work through the economy. Waiting another year to get aggressive only delays the timeframe further. And at least our Fed has the ability to tighten considerably right now--the same can\\'t necessarily be said for Europe or Japan, leaving us, as is so often the case, as the biggest available player to tame global inflationary pressures.\\n\\nIndeed, Europe had to call an \"ad hoc\" (i.e. emergency) central bank meeting this morning to reassure markets that as yields of slower-growth economies start to jump in response to less central bank bond purchases, they remain committed to \"act against resurgent fragmentation risks.\" This for the region that also has the worst inflation because of soaring energy prices; thankfully the U.S. is more insulated thanks to our larger domestic energy industry.\\n\\nSo yes, markets have had to digest a lot already this year. But that\\'s pushed the Fed much closer to an appropriately tight monetary policy. To give up or pause now would feel to markets a bit like that famous Tennessee Titans Super Bowl where they came up just one yard short of a touchdown and lost the game in the final moments.\\n\\n\"We are much closer to pricing in a realistic tightening path now than we were a few weeks or months ago,\" wrote MKM\\'s Michael Darda yesterday. If the Fed \"actually pulls the trigger,\" on market expectations of a 75-basis-point hike today, and similar future tightening, he said, it could mean \"the collapse in equity valuations may be (mostly) behind us now.\"',\n",

       "  'body': 'These numbers suggest that an upcoming recession is, by no means, a certainty\\n\\nThe stock market panicked Friday after the release of last month\\'s inflation report, which showed May prices rising 8.6% year-over-year. Even when excluding food and energy prices, which tend to fluctuate more, annual inflation sat at a robust 6%.\\n\\nEach of the major stock indices slumped Friday on the news. By Monday\\'s close, stocks had plunged even further, officially dragging the S&P 500 into bear market territory.\\n\\nInflation began rising last year after the pandemic economy reopened and supply chain snarls snaggled various markets. Now, almost a year since the first echoes of inflation tickled the economy, we\\'re barreling along at the fastest rate seen since 1981.\\n\\nTo combat this 40-year-high price growth, the Federal Reserve has already instituted 0.25% and 0.5% rate hikes this year. But now, after stating that higher hikes weren\\'t in the cards, it\\'s looking increasingly likely that the Fed could spike rates an additional 0.75% this week.\\n\\nUnfortunately, all these inflationary pressures, interest rate hike fears and uncertainty stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war have taken their toll. Despite a tight labor market, many consumers aren\\'t feeling too happy about current economic conditions. Many -- consumers, investors and analysts alike -- have worries about a potential recession on the horizon.\\n\\nBut this week, the Bank of America offered some comforting words: At the moment, a full-blown recession may not be as likely as many believe.\\n\\nThe Bank of America\\'s earlier sentiments trickled out Friday, courtesy of Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett. According to Hartnett, the bank\\'s in-house bull and bear indicator resides deep in \"contrarian bullish\" territory. Hartnett also noted that, \"we\\'re in a technical recession [now], but just don\\'t realize it.\"\\n\\nHartnett\\'s take on current consumer data and household balance sheets indicates that a \"shallow\" recession lies ahead. He counted price spikes in food, natural gas (and other energy sources) and housing among those leading the inflation charge.\\n\\nBut on Monday, the Bank of America\\'s Chief Financial Officer Alastair Borthwick offered a more comforting message. According to numbers in the bank\\'s loan and credit portfolio, there\\'s no substantial signs of a looming recession.\\n\\nBorthwick counted among his evidence the fact that customer spending is up 9% in June compared to last year\\'s number. And the bank\\'s corporate clients haven\\'t halted borrowing activities, with \"reasonably good loan growth\" seen across the board.\\n\\nDespite ongoing spending, credit card balances remain lower now than they did pre-pandemic, suggesting that consumers aren\\'t over-extending their budgets.\\n\\nBorthwick said: \"There\\'s this question of what will happen in the future, and there\\'s what we are seeing right now. And what we\\'re seeing right now, credit is in great shape.\"\\n\\nAt the same time, the bank\\'s retail customers continue to store cash rather than spend it. He gave the example of customers who maintained account balances around $1,000-$2,500 pre-pandemic now hoarding around seven times that amount.\\n\\nAll told, the bank continues to see \"very healthy balance sheets and healthy spending.\"\\n\\nAnd coming from the second-largest U.S. bank (by assets), these numbers paint a more uplifting picture of the economy than others have in recent weeks.\\n\\nBorthwick\\'s comments contrast with the views of JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. Dimon noted earlier this month that factors like high inflation and the Russia-Ukraine conflict are like a \"hurricane\" on the road ahead.\\n\\nMeanwhile, executives at a Morgan Stanleyfinancial industry conference took a more middling view. The broad consensus was that U.S. consumers and companies remain strong financially, which will allow them to weather a contraction and recover strongly. However, that doesn\\'t mean that a recession isn\\'t possible - simply that the economy won\\'t stay stuck in a deep rut.\\n\\nFor instance, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman noted that there\\'s a \"possible\" recession ahead, setting the odds at \"50-50.\" This is a revision of his own former forecast, where he set the likelihood of a recession around a 30% chance.\\n\\nGorman noted: \"I think eventually the Fed will get hold of inflation. It\\'s going to be bumpy... But we\\'re unlikely at this stage to go into a deep or long recession.\"\\n\\nAnd, like Borthwick, Gorman believes that consumer and corporate balance sheets remain \"very strong,\" and that he doesn\\'t think the economy will fall into \"some massive hole\" in the near future.\\n\\nThis sentiment echoes Goldman Sachs\\' previously-stated position that a U.S. recession is not inevitable -- despite what the stock market might suggest. Chief Economist Jan Hatzius stated in a client note: \"While our growth forecast has long been below consensus, we believe fears of declining economic activity this year will prove overblown unless new negative shocks materialize.\"\\n\\nIn other words, though Goldman Sachs sees a \"deceleration\" in the cards, a \"collapse\" is not yet on the table.\\n\\nIt\\'s no small matter that top executives at two of Wall Street\\'s biggest banks remained positive in the face of scary inflation data this week. But that doesn\\'t mean you shouldn\\'t prepare yourself for the possibility that a recession could occur, no matter how mild.\\n\\nThat\\'s why, recession or no recession, Q.ai has got your back. With a wide variety of AI-backed Investment Kits to choose from, you can buffer your portfolio from multiple angles.\\n\\nFor instance, take stock in our Large Cap Kit, which is designed to help investors benefit from the long-term macro view that U.S. GDP growth will be slow. It\\'s also designed to appreciate in value whichever way the markets move -- just so long as small-cap companies continue to underperform larger ones (as they tend to do in these environments).\\n\\nThere\\'s also the Inflation Kit, which can help protect your portfolio against rapidly rising prices. And to cap it all off, you can rest easy investing with Portfolio Protection, which adds an extra layer of financial security during these turbulent times.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Following are excerpts from the unofficial transcript of a CNBC interview with DoubleLine Capital CEO, CIO and Co-Founder Jeffrey Gundlach on CNBC\\'s \"Closing Bell: Overtime\" (M-F, 4PM-5PM ET) today, Wednesday, June 15. Following are links to video on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/15/short-inflation-may-fall-around-6-percent-by-year-end-says-doubleline-ceo-jeffrey-gundlach.html and https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/15/the-economy-isnt-as-strong-as-people-say-warns-doubleline-ceo-jeffrey-gundlach.html.\\n\\nJEFFREY GUNDLACH: So by September, it looks like we\\'re gonna be at around that range will be 2.50 to 2.75. And I don\\'t really know what the difference is between raising it to 3 now and raising it in two steps in September. The inflation rate is so high, and this idea that it\\'s about to come down to anything close to the 2% level is completely out of the cards if you look at the data right now. Our model at DoubleLine is looking for an inflation rate to stay in the eight handle now for a couple more months, maybe even print a little higher based on the fact that commodity prices got even more elevated, particularly energy. And so by year end, we might get inflation down into the high sixes. But when you\\'re talking about the goal of 2% and repeatedly committing to that as an essential goal, I think he said to even allow for a functioning economy, you need that kind of price stability. We\\'re so far away. I just don\\'t see how we\\'re going to avoid that 3% number happening basically by the September meeting or something very, very close to it. So very much as expected because the Fed told you on Monday what they were going to do.\\n\\nGUNDLACH ON FED CREDIBILITY LACKING\\n\\nGUNDLACH: Well, one thing that\\'s amazing about the credibility issue is the Fed is making these predictions for rates a year from now being at what 3.8 or something like that, and May of next year and that being the high point, that all these inflation predictions for next year and the year after. Where the credibility is really lacking is why are you bothering with all of these predictions for one year and two years from now when you have when you had a complete U-turn on some of the things you said six weeks ago and a complete U-turn on things you said, you know, six months ago, so I just don\\'t take those credible at all on those predictions.\\n\\nGUNDLACH ON 3 PERCENT TYPE INTEREST RATE NOW\\n\\nGUNDLACH: They\\'re following the bond market. It\\'s appropriate they do so as many commentators have said today, and I think accurately, it is nice to see that the Fed\\'s predictions for year end are finally matching what\\'s going on with the two-year Treasury but they have to execute on it. That\\'s why I think it\\'s I just think that they should I think they should paint or get off the ladder basically when it comes to meeting this goal of that 3% type of interest rate. We should get there now.\\n\\nGUNDLACH ON BOND MARKET CALMING DOWN\\n\\nGUNDLACH: I think the bond market has obviously been calmed down at least for now because you know, there\\'s there\\'s less uncertainty as we talked about six weeks ago. At least there\\'s less uncertainty about where we\\'re going but the Fed heading to 3.4%, my suspicion is that the two-year Treasury is going to start heading higher again because the inflation prints are not going to be pretty. The next two that are coming out will probably be somewhat stable relative to today\\'s level.\\n\\nGUNDLACH ON FED OVERSTEERING\\n\\nGUNDLACH: They can, they can see what happens they can go to 3.5 or 4 or what they\\'re predicting 3.8 and just wait and see what happens. But the rest of his messaging is full of flexibility, being nimble, being data dependent. So it looks like they\\'re trying to get to a place, you know, destination in the next year or two but they\\'re what they\\'re looking at is almost day to day and so they\\'re oversteering I think constantly.\\n\\nGUNDLACH ON FED BEING FLEXIBLE\\n\\nGUNDLACH: I\\'m completely in favor of that and here\\'s how I propose doing it. Put the Fed funds rate to 3% right now and be flexible and if the data really starts to soften, bring it back down. That\\'s also flexibility. The flexibility we\\'re doing now is hoping that something good happens, but kind of fearing that that good thing isn\\'t going to happen so messaging that we\\'re going to, you know, hope for the best but plan for further increases and that\\'s called flexibility. I call it hope.\\n\\nGUNDLACH ON ECONOMIC GROWTH\\n\\nGUNDLACH: I think it\\'s eye catching frankly or ear catching that everyone keeps talking about how wildly strong this economy is. I mean GDP was negative in the first quarter and GDP now from the Atlanta Fed for the second quarter is now at zero, and has been trending in a southward direction for the last few months. So, where\\'s the strong economy? I mean retail sales aren\\'t exactly strong. Personal consumption expenditures, they look strong because there\\'s inflation in there. You know, housing has become extremely less affordable. The average monthly payment, the monthly payment on a median home, if you just take the median home price and the 30-year commitment rate, that payment is up by 45% year to date. So it\\'s pretty obvious that these higher mortgage rates which have doubled in just the past several months are going to cut into things.',\n",

       "  'body': 'By Jeffrey T. Lewis and Paulo Trevisani\\n\\nSÃO PAULO--Brazil\\'s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate for the 11th consecutive time amid signs of slowing inflation and economic growth and signaled another rate boost at its next meeting.\\n\\nThe bank\\'s monetary policy committee, known as the Copom, raised the Selic rate by a half point to 13.25%, the highest level in more than five years. The bank said it is still waiting to see the effects on the economy from its previous hikes, and that it foresees another rate increase of the same size or smaller at its next meeting, in August.\\n\\n\"The Committee stresses that the growing uncertainty of the current scenario, coupled with the advanced stage of the current monetary policy cycle, and its impacts yet to be observed, require additional caution in its actions,\" the Copom statement said.\\n\\nAlthough the rate decision met expectations, the fact that the central bank indicated tightening will likely continue, with another rate increase in the next meeting, split analysts.\\n\\n\"The bank missed an opportunity to end the cycle, [but] they lacked courage,\" said Sergio Machado from investment firm SF2 Investimentos, who fears a recession may ensue. \"I worry rates this high will choke the economy.\"\\n\\nBut Adriano Cantreva, partner at asset manager Portofino Multi Family Office, said that although global central banks are moving faster to tame inflation, in Brazil there are fiscal risks that need to be accounted for.\\n\\n\"They didn\\'t leave room to keep rates unchanged because there is an election coming,\" likely leading the government to spend more, which could add inflationary pressures. \"The central bank did the right thing.\"\\n\\nThe move comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point, to a 1.5%-to-1.75% range, as inflation and inflation expectations increased in May, more than expected. Other central banks in the developed world also are moving to tighten monetary policy to tame consumer prices.\\n\\nThe Copom began the cycle of rate increases in March of last year, lifting the Selic from a record low of 2%, as consumer-price gains began to accelerate. Many economists say it can take more than a year for rate increases to start to damp demand and that the full impact of the higher cost of borrowing will only be felt in the second half of this year.\\n\\n\"My expectation is that GDP will be flat in the second half, and that stagnation will be a result of the rate increases,\" said Gino Olivares, chief economist at Azimut Brasil Wealth Management. \"Inflation is a bit harder to project because we\\'re still subject to various shocks, but in terms of 12-month inflation, we\\'ve probably seen the worst and should start to see a slow decline.\"\\n\\nThe 12-month inflation rate declined to 11.73% in May from an 18-year high of 12.13% the previous month, the first time this year the figure fell. Retail sales grew at the slowest pace this year in April, and services growth measured by volume slowed in April from March, according to Brazil\\'s statistics agency.\\n\\nThe administration of President Jair Bolsonaro is also moving to enact measures to bring down inflation. A bill to limit states\\' sales taxes on fuel was approved Wednesday by Congress, and many economists say it should help slow the pace of consumer-price increases ahead of Brazil\\'s October presidential election.\\n\\nThe central bank also will consider the election, which polls suggest former left-wing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will win, when making their next decisions about interest rates, according to Daniel Pegorini, chief executive of Valora Investimentos asset-management firm. Policy makers are likely to be wary of lowering the Selic until they have a clearer view of the next government\\'s fiscal policies, he said.\\n\\n\"In our opinion, it would be a bit risky to try to start to cut rates with the election coming. We always think that the Copom will be more conservative and so will opt to start cutting rates starting in the beginning of next year,\" he said.\\n\\nWrite to Jeffrey T.

We are closely monitoring three consumer-oriented indicators - jobless claims, housing permits and wage growth - for signs that demand is tightening and inflation is cooling.\\n\\nInvestors have endured a poor start to 2022: U.S. equity performance for the first five months ranked as the sixth worst since 1928. The second quarter has been particularly painful. April and May witnessed the first run of seven successive weekly declines since the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2001. Thankfully, markets bounced back when the Fed\\'s minutes conveyed a message less hawkish than feared, and the S&P 500 Index finished roughly flat (+0.18%) for May.\\n\\nEarly signs show that monetary policy is impacting the housing market: 30-year fixed rate mortgages rose from 3.1% at the start of the year to 5.1% in late May. Monthly mortgage payments for the median home increased by 27%. Factoring in home price appreciation, median home monthly mortgage payments have risen 40% in 2022, a meaningful hit to affordability.\\n\\nHome prices remain strong, and low inventories are providing downside support. Housing activity forges ahead, given backlogs. Building permits fell modestly in April but remain robust. A cooling housing market would be welcome for offsetting inflation (and by the Fed), but it will take time to show up in CPI.\\n\\nTurning to the labor market, with close historical relationships between compensation, consumption and inflation, slowing wage gains should help curb demand. In this unique cycle, the Fed may have a fighting chance of bringing down wage growth without causing a recession. This could occur from both sides, from a balance of more workers re-entering the labor force while companies\\' needs diminish after dramatic hiring efforts.\\n\\nThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) remains elevated, but high-frequency (and unlagged, unlike JOLTS) data from indeed.com and Revelio Labs suggest labor demand is cooling. The Institute for Supply Management Manufacturing survey\\'s employment sub-component slipped into contraction territory (49.6) in the most recent release. While hiring freezes and layoffs have been announced in the technology sector, investors should focus on signs of spread into other industries.\\n\\nUpticks in initial jobless claims can herald recession, and they rose from a low of 166,000 in mid-March to 200,000 in late May. They bounced back off their lowest level in 53 years, so some normalization was likely. Year over year, initial jobless claims are down 53%. This metric should continue to provide a good barometer of any damage tighter Fed monetary policy is causing.\\n\\nAs the cost of money rises, companies may demand less labor and curb expansion plans. Whether this will result in fewer job openings or substantially more layoffs remains to be seen.\\n\\nA \"softish\" landing for the economy continues to be the most likely path forward. The health of the U.S. consumer remains strong, bolstered by accumulated savings, compensation gains and ample borrowing capacity. The financial position of households, however, is beginning to slide.\\n\\nWhy? Inflation is pushing spending up faster than incomes. The savings rate fell to 4.4% last month, its lowest level since 2008, when consumers were in the depths of the Global Financial Crisis.\\n\\nConsumers may be beginning to bend, but we do not believe they will break.\\n\\nJeffrey Schulze, CFA , is a director and investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments, a subsidiary of Franklin Templeton.

       " {'title': 'A Key Inflation Reading Capturing Wholesale Prices Rose Again in May',\n",
       "  'body': 'The producer-price index, which measures what suppliers are charging businesses and other customers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in May from the prior month, up from a 0.4% monthly gain in April, the Labor Department said Tuesday.\\n\\nProducer prices had moderated somewhat in April, after the March gain had been the highest since records began in 2010, pushed up by surging energy prices after Russia invaded Ukraine.\\n\\nThe so-called core price index -- which excludes the often-volatile categories of food, energy and supplier margins -- rose 0.5% after a 0.4% gain the prior month.\\n\\nOn an annualized basis, the PPI rose 10.8% in May from a year ago, down slightly from a revised 10.9% in April. May marked the sixth consecutive month of double-digit annual gains for producer prices.\\n\\nEconomists are watching producer- and consumer-price indexes closely for signs that inflation could be peaking. With the annual increase in consumer prices ticking back up in May to 8.6%, Federal Reserve officials are contemplating a larger-than-expected 0.75-percentage-point interest-rate increase at their meeting this week. Continued pressure on producer prices often signals future rises in consumer inflation as costs pass through supply chains.\\n\\nElevated producer prices suggest that consumer prices \"would continue to have upward pressure in the coming months,\" said PNC economist Kurt Rankin. While the relationship between the two measurements is indirect, that pattern has been consistent as the economy emerges from its pandemic-induced slowdown. May\\'s jump in consumer inflation didn\\'t come as a total surprise because \"PPI was telling us that this number was coming, that inflation was going to stay high in response to higher oil prices,\" Mr. Rankin said.\\n\\nConsumer demand for goods and services has outpaced supply. Shortages of commodities such as wheat and precious metals, along with new restrictions on buying Russian oil, have been exacerbated by the continuing war in Ukraine. Rolling Covid-19 lockdowns in China have roiled supply chains that had begun to resolve snarls from earlier in the pandemic.\\n\\nSustained high prices for inputs that have been in short supply because of the war and other global trade issues are unlikely to be resolved soon and have likely become baked into prices for other goods and services, economists say.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, executives at food suppliers and restaurant chains have complained of rapidly rising prices for labor, packaging, ingredients and transportation. The rising cost of fuel is making it more expensive to produce and sell food. Food retailers and restaurants have said they are passing along some wholesale price increases and additional costs to consumers.\\n\\nIn the early stages of the current period of inflation, many companies were able to pass higher costs along to consumers by raising prices. Analysts expect the S&P 500 net profit margin to come in at 12.3% for the first quarter, above the five-year average of 11.1%, according to FactSet. But there are signs that that trend may be reaching its end.\\n\\nThe stock market has been jolted by high-profile examples of costs squeezing corporate earnings. Last month, Walmart Inc. said higher product, supply-chain and employee costs eroded its profit. Target Corp. shares plummeted 25% the following day after the company said it would absorb elevated costs this year instead of raising prices.\\n\\n\"The benign explanation from an inflation standpoint is that consumers are beginning to resist price hikes, which would be bad news for retail profitability but might signal a forthcoming cooling of inflation,\" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. Another explanation, he said, is that \"stores misread how much they needed to raise prices to recoup their higher costs\" and will continue to raise prices going forward.\\n\\nAlong with higher prices from suppliers, businesses are dealing with an unusually tight U.S. labor market, with demand for workers outstripping supply by nearly two job openings for every available unemployed worker. Although there are some early signs the labor market is starting to cool, employers added 390,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate hovered near a half-century low at 3.6%. Fewer Americans are employed as a share of the population than before the pandemic, even after a run of gains that has led to the creation of 6.5 million jobs in a year.\\n\\nAs a measure of price pressures, the PPI differs from the Labor Department\\'s more widely followed consumer-price index, which only measures the final prices paid directly by households for goods and services.\\n\\nThe PPI also includes prices paid by companies, governments, third-party payers such as insurers and buyers in other countries. The CPI, unlike the PPI, includes taxes and user charges and the prices of imported goods and services, because they are part of the total costs paid by consumers.',\n",
